Materials   N-Isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM, 97.0 %, Aldrich) was recrystallized from n-hexane prior to   use. Pyrrole (98.0 %), N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED), potassium persulfate, N,N′-  methylenebisacrylamide (BIS), reduced graphene oxide (RGO), multiwalled carbon nanotubes,   Nafion solution (20 %), and indium tin oxide covered glass substrate were obtained from Sigma   Aldrich and used without purification. Acetone, methyl orange, ethanol 99.5 %, n-hexane were   purchased from PENTA. Cellulose membrane was obtained from Spectrum Labs.  2. Samples preparation  2.1 PPy nanotubes synthesis   PPy nanotubes (PPyNTs) were prepared via MO-FeCl3 template method.S1 First, 0.243 g of   FeCl3 was dissolved in 30 ml of 5 mM solution of methyl orange (MO). Then, 105 µl of pyrrole was   added. The solution became black, indicating the polymerization of pyrrole. The mixture was stirred   on ice bath and then at room temperature for 24 h to complete polymerization. The precipitate was   washed with deionized water and ethanol several times, then placed in Soxhlet extractor (acetone)   and cleaned for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks the PPyNTs were dried and used for preparation of conductive   hydrogel.  2.2 PPyNTs doped PNIPAm hydrogel l synthesis   The hydrogels were prepared according to modified procedure.S2 First, 25 ml of deionized   water was placed in round-bottom flask and bubbled with argon gas for 10 min to remove the   dissolved oxygen. Then, to prepare pristine PNIPAm hydrogel 0.8475 g of NIPAM, 0.00232 g of   BIS, 0.0135 g of potassium persulfate were dissolved in 5 ml of deionized water. Next, the mixture   was cooled on the ice bath and 20 µl of TEMED were added prior to polymerization. Polymerization   was performed at 0 °C for 24 h between two glasses with spacers. The doped hydrogels were prepared   by addition of different amount of dry PPy nanotubes to polymerization mixture. Finally, the   hydrogels were cleaned for 1 week in 2 L of deionized water with refreshing the water twice a day.  2.3 Supercapacitor fabrication  The supercapacitor was fabricated by intertwining of PNIPAm/PPy film, used as a negative   electrode against the RGO/MWCNT paper (positive electrode). As a charge collector the metal mesh   was used from carbon side and ITO electrode from the PNIPAm/PPy side. The carbon paper was   prepared according to [https://doi.org/10.1039/C3TA13953K] by filtering of RGO/MWCNT   suspension and peeling off residual carbon material from filters surface.

Measurements  Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed by JEOL JEM-1010 transmission   electron microscope, with SIS MegaView III digital camera. Sample wettability was determined   below and above LCST by a drop shape analyzer (DSA 100, KRÜSS GmbH, DE). The measurements   of contact angles were performed using distilled water. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra   were measured in a total reflectance mode (ATR) by Nicolet 6700 spectrometer (Thermo Scientific,   France). Scanning electron microscopy was conducted by Tescan Lyra3 GMU microscope with 10   kV acceleration voltage. UV-Vis spectra were measured by Lambda 25 Spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer).   Surface resistance measurements were performed using Keithley 487 picoampermeter on films   deposited on glass substrate and equipped with two flat electrodes attached to samples surface. The   evaluation of temperature was performed using leaf type thermocouple. Mechanical compression and   tensile tests of PNIPAm/PPyNTs hydrogel samples were performed using a tensile machine,   equipped with IMADA ZTN rorce gauge. The hydrogel samples were fixed by two clamps and the   stretch rate was 30 mm min−1 for both loading and unloading.  The electrochemical properties of PNIPAm/PPyNTs thin films were characterized in  a three-  electrode electrochemical cell system using Palm Sens 4 (Palm Instruments, the Netherlands),   controlled by PSTrace 5.3 software. The pinned to a metal grid PNIPAm/PPyNTs acted as working   electrode, an Ag/AgCl (KCl, 3 M) and a Pt wire (0.5 mm diameter) were used as a counter and   reference electrodes. Measurements were performed in 0.1 M H2SO4 aqueous solution. In impedance   measurements an equivalent electrical circuit, comprising solution resistance, contact interface   resistance, constant phase element, and Warburg diffusion resistance was used. Electrochemical   measurements were performed in pristine and triggered PNIPAm/PPyNTs states. Supercapacitor   characterization was performed in two electrode system,  with Palm Sens 4 device and using 0.1 M   H2SO4 aqueous solution as electrolyte.   Electrochemical measurements were performed either in pristine sample state or after   application of external triggering. Part of the measurements includes the dynamic control of samples   properties (PNIPAm/PPyNTs films or supercapacitor), where the external stimuli was switched ON   or OFF with some delay in relation to the beginning of the measurements.  The supercapacitor charge/discharge was also measured in optimized mode, where the   charging was performed under constant potential, while discharging under constant electrical loading.

In summary, after   undergoing large deformation, the appearance of the PDA-clay-PAM hydrogel quickly   recovered to original shape if the load was removed.

Hydrogel preparation  The solution of PVA in PBS (8 wt%, pH ~ 7.4) was prepared by dissolving PVA   powders (3.2 g) in 36.8 g of PBS (pH ~ 7.4). A series solution of P1 in PBS (8 wt%, 10   wt%, and 12 wt%) were prepared by dissolving 0.24 g, 0.30 g, 0.36 g of P1 in 2.76 g,   2.70 g, and 2.64 g of PBS (pH ~ 7.4), respectively. As a typical example, to prepare   Gel-8/12, PVA in PBS (8 wt%, 0.30 mL) and P1 in PBS (12 wt%, 0.30 mL) were mixed   at 25℃. The hydrogel was formed after vortex (~ 8 sec).   Other hydrogels (Gel-8/8, Gel-8/10) were similarly prepared.  3.4. Rheology analysis  Typically, a piece of hydrogel (~ 0.6 mL) was put on the measuring plate of a   rheometer. The storage modulus (G’) and loss modulus (G”) of the hydrogel were   recorded under different conditions (frequency, strain and temperature).   All hydrogels were tested through the same process.  3.5. Self-healing property analyses  1) The self-healing experiments were carried out as previously reports1. A   hydrogel (~ 2.0 cm diameters) was prepared. Then, a hole (~ 1.0 cm diameter) was   punched in the middle of the hydrogel. Photos were taken at different time intervals to   monitor the self-healing process.  2) Rheology analyses were further carried out to test the shear-thinning property   of the hydrogels (25℃). Typically, Gel-8/12 was prepared as above described. The   moduli of Gel-8/12 under different strains were tested. Then, alternative changed stains   (1%, 400%) under the same frequency (1.0 Hz) were applied to Gel-8/12.

Hence, we selected the mass ratio of XG to PAM was 0.5 wt.%. Secondly, we   adjusted the mass ratio of CNF to XG-PAM, and found that the mechanical strength of   XG-PAM/CNF were enhanced while the elasticity of XG-PAM/CNF were weakened   with the increasing contents of CNF (","=HYPERLINK(""sem/10.1021_acsami.0c12313\supp_2.jpg"",""sem/10.1021_acsami.0c12313\supp_2.jpg"")"

Structural and Morphological Characterization of Hydrogels    Structural analysis of hydrogel adhesives was performed using a Fourier transform   infrared (FTIR) spectrometer (Nicolet 5700, Thermo Fisher Scientific, America). The   samples were recorded in the wavelength range of 4000-500 cm-1 using KBr. The   microstructure and surface morphology of cross sections of the freeze-dried hydrogels   was observed using a field emission scanning electron microscope (Ultra Plus, Carl   Zeiss, Germany).       Swelling Behavior   The as-prepared hydrogel samples [cylinder, diameter (D) = 6.4 mm, height (H) = 10   mm] were immersed in saline and weighed at specific time to investigate swelling   behavior via the traditional swelling method at room temperature. The swelling rate   was defined as follows (N = 5)                    Swelling Rate (%)  =  𝑊𝑊𝑠𝑠  − 𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖 𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖   × 100%                (1)   where Ws and Wi are the weight of the swelling samples at a given time and the original   samples, respectively.

The nominal stress is the applied force divided   by the cross-sectional area of the undeform sample. The strain is the length of deformed   sample divided by the initial length. The elastic modulus of tensile samples was   obtained by calculating the slope of the stress-strain curve in the linear region.

Rheological Measurement   Dynamic rheological properties of the as-prepared hydrogel samples [cylinder, D =   25 mm, H = 1.0 mm] were characterized at 25 °C using a strain-controlled rheometer   equipped with 25 mm parallel plates (MCR 302, Anton Paar, Austria). The dynamic   frequency sweeps were performed in the linear viscoelastic region of materials at 1.0%   strain amplitude. The loss factor (tanδ) was defined as the ratio of loss modulus (G'') to   storage modulus (G').       Adhesion Test    The adhesion strength of hydrogel adhesives was investigated by the standard lap-  shear test (ASTM F2255) with a tensile testing machine (FLR-303, Flora Automatic   Technology, China) at the testing speed of 10 mm∙min-1. All glass substrates were   pretreated by rinsing with ethanol and deionized water and then dried before test. The   lap shear joint [length (L) × width (W) = 25 × 25 mm] was completely fabricated by   adding 100 μL pre-gel adhesive solution between two substrates. The as-prepared joint   with a stainless steel clip was placed in air for 6 h (dry environment groups) or in saline   for a specific time (saline environment groups) (28 °C, 50 %RH). After that, the   samples of the saline group were taken out and dried in air for 6 h. Shear adhesive   strength was defined as the ratio of maximum tensile force at joint failure to the joint   overlap area (N = 5).      Cytocompatibility Evaluation   In vitro cytocompatibility tests were conducted using the hydrogel-conditioned   media for cell culture. L929 and HUVEC were cultured in DMEM and RPMI-1640   supplemented with 10 wt % FBS and 100 U∙mL-1 penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in   5% CO2 for all subsequent cell experiments, respectively.

The supernatant solution was passed through the ion exchange   resin to remove the Li cations in air atmosphere. Finally, the aqueous Mo3Se3 - solutions after   ion exchange are used for the preparation of Mo3Se3 - reinforced gelatin hydrogel.      Preparation of composite hydrogel by simple mixing:    The composite hydrogel was prepared by simply mixing gelatin type A with various   concentrations (0, 0.003, 0.01, and 0.05 wt%) of Mo3Se3 - chain nanowire. Final concentration   of gelatin used in each composite hydrogel was 15 wt%. After heating over 70 oC, the mixed   solution was poured into a mold and cooled down to 4 oC.      Preparation of composite hydrogel by polymer wrapping method:    To find the appropriate wrapping ratio between gelatin and Mo3Se3 - chain nanowire, a solution   containing various concentrations of gelatin polymer (20 mL; 0, 0.02, 0.06, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, and   2 wt%) was poured to Mo3Se3 - nanowire solution (20 mL and 0.02 wt%). The solution   containing both gelatin and Mo3Se3 - chain nanowire was then ultrasonicated for about 30 min   and then shaken for 90 min with a constant stirring at 400 rpm. After adding additional gelatin   powder into the solution containing gelatin wrapped Mo3Se3 - nanowire, the mixed solution was   heated at 70 oC, poured into a mold, and cooled down to 4 oC. The final gelatin concentration   in each composite hydrogel sample was 15 wt%. Because the tensile strength and fracture strain   of the composite hydrogel had maximum values when gelatin / Mo3Se3 - was 25, this condition   was used for most experiments.      Zeta potential measurement:    We used Malvern Zetasizer Nano-ZS90 (UK) with 4 mW He-Ne laser operating at 633 nm for   Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS measurement). DLS measurements were performed with   triplicate samples and error bar indicates stand deviation of the measurement.

China.  *Corresponding author: znie@fudan.edu.cn  Finite Element Modeling Simulation on Shape Transformations of Composite Hydrogel Sheet.   Free energy model of temperature-responsive hydrogel. In our PNIPAm hydrogel, the  interacting aggregation of cross-linked polymer chain network and solvent molecules constitutes a  thermodynamic system of which the macroscopic behaviors are governed by its thermodynamic  energetics. The deformation of PNIPAm hydrogel in balance with mechanical loads and a solvent  reservoir can be modeled by the framework developed by Cai and Suo.1 By thermodynamics  consideration, the Helmholtz free energy of a swelling hydrogel arises from two origins: (i) the  stretching of the polymer network and (ii) the mixing of the two species of molecules. Hence the  free energy density function takes the form:  𝑊 = 1 2  𝑁𝑘𝑇[𝐅:𝐅 ― 3 ― 2log(𝐽)] + 𝑘𝑇[𝑐log( 𝑣𝑐1 + 𝑣𝑐) + (𝐴0 + 𝐵0𝑇)𝑐1 + 𝑣𝑐 + (𝐴1 + 𝐵1𝑇)𝑐(1 + 𝑣𝑐)2 ] (1) where  is the free energy per unit volume in the dry state, N is the number of polymer chains per  𝑊 unit volume in the dry state, k is Boltzmann constant, T is the current temperature at the material  point, F is the deformation gradient tensor which takes the original dry state as reference frame, J  is the Jacobian of deformation gradient tensor, i.e., J=det(F), v is the molecular volume of water, c  is the relative concentration of solvent molecules in the hydrogel-solvent aggregation, and A0, B0,  A1 and B1 are parameters related to the enthalpy of mixing. The first term in Equation (1) denotes  that the stretching of polymer chain network obeys a neo-Hookean hyperelastic material law, and  the second term implies that the mixing of PNIPAM polymer and water molecules follows the  Flory-Huggins theory of solution. A0, B0, A1 and B1 in Equation (1) are to be fitted to the  experimental data for different temperature-responsive hydrogels, as we will identify in the  immediate section for our composite hydrogel.  Equation (1) specifies the explicit expression of the free energy density function which takes  the extensive variables F, c as well as the intensive variable T as its arguments. In such cases that    ","=HYPERLINK(""sem/10.1021_acsami.9b16610\supp_0.jpg"",""sem/10.1021_acsami.9b16610\supp_0.jpg"")"

In other words it also depicts how the hydrogel deforms in response to the change of  the homogeneous temperature field.   By fitting the function T(λ|S=0, μ=0) to the experimentally obtained T~J relation, we  determined the parameters Nv, A0, B0, A1 and B1 as Nv=0.03317, A0=-2.5418, B0=0.01081,  A1=0.57099, B1=-0.000418. We will use this set of parameters for our PNIPAM hydrogel in the  following calculations.   Model of heat transfer processes.  When the top surface is exposed to NIR laser, the IONPs  embedded in PNIPAm absorb the photons and convert the light energy into heat, the surrounding  hydrogel matrix is thus heated. We determined previously the thermal diffusivity of PNIPAm  hydrogel α=K/ρCp=2.36×10-5 cm2/s, where K, ρ and Cp denote the thermal conductivity, density,  and specific heat of the material respectively.3 This thermal diffusivity was used in our present  study.  Deformation of PNIPAm hydrogel in inhomogeneous temperature field.  The deformation  behavior of a temperature-sensitive hydrogel is governed by a thermodynamic free energy thus  resembling a hyperelastic material. Each thermodynamic equilibrium state of temperature-sensitive  hydrogel is a local minimum of the system free energy which can be fully defined by the stretch  ratios λ and a dependent solvent molecule concentration c as discussed above. Furthermore, the  thermodynamic equilibrium is to be altered upon the change of environment variables. Therefore  besides of being able to respond to the conventional mechanical loads, such materials as PNIPAm  hydrogels are also able to deform in accordance with the change in temperature and chemical  potential.   Solving for the equilibrium states is a boundary value problem (BVP). For simpler cases, e.g.,  free swelling hydrogel with homogeneous temperature, analytical solution can be obtained,  whereas for more complicated case, e.g., hydrogel swelling in an inhomogeneous temperature field,  the BVP can be solved numerically by FEM. We adopted the FEM framework established by Ding  et al. for the temperature-responsive hydrogel,4 and prescribed the material properties determined  above to the PNIPAm hydrogel used in this study.  At this stage we assume that the deformation of  PNIPAm hydrogel will not affect the heat transfer processes. A fully coupled thermo-mechanical  algorithm is implemented in the commercial FEM package ABAQUS by making use of its  temperature-displacement elements.

Experimental section   Compression tests: The compression test of the hydrogel was carried out using the UTM.   Four hydrogels, including PAM, CS-PAM, PDA-PAM, and PDA-CS-PAM hydrogels, were   tested. The dimension of the cylindrical hydrogel samples was 10 mm in height and 22 mm in   diameter. The compressive strain was calculated as ε=h/h0, where h is the deformed height   and h0 is the initial height. The nominal compression stress was calculated as σ=F/S, where F   is the compressive load and S is the original area of the sample. The compression strength   was defined as the stress when the compress strain reached to 80%. During the compression,   the speed of cross-head was 1 mm/s and the load cell was 200 N.      In vitro swelling and degradation of the hydrogels: In vitro swelling and degradation   studies were carried out in phosphate buffer solution (PBS, pH 7.4) at 37 °C. Four kinds of   hydrogels, including PAM, PDA-PAM, CS-PAM, and PDA-CS-PAM hydrogels were   prepared and tested. The initial weight (W0) of all the hydrogels was recorded prior to   immersion in PBS. At pre-selected time points (1, 3, 7, 15, 21, 30, 35 days), the hydrogels   were removed from PBS and were dried to constant weight at 60 °C for 24 h. The weight of   sample was recorded and compared with the initial dry weight to determine weight change of   hydrogels. The results were reported as weight change ratio versus time.      Adhesion test: The tissue adhesiveness of the hydrogels was characterized by a   tensile-adhesion test on a universal mechanical testing machine (UTM, Intron 5567, USA).   The hydrogel were adhered to the porcine skin, which was used to mimic the natural tissue,    ","=HYPERLINK(""sem/10.1021_acsami.8b05314\supp_2.jpg"",""sem/10.1021_acsami.8b05314\supp_2.jpg"")"

The oligopeptide hydrogel was prepared by the protease-triggered self-assembly 6 . Briefly, the   precursors, Fmoc-F (10 mM) and F-F-DOPA (20 mM), were dissolved in 0.8 mL of phosphate   buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4). The gelation was triggered by adding 200 μL of W-NC (1 mg/mL)   and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. For the drug loading, hirudin (2 mg/mL) and TRAIL (0.1 mg/mL)   were added in the precursor solution prior to the addition of W-NC.           The rheology was investigated using a rheometer (Anton-Paar MCR302). The oligopeptide   hydrogel was prepared on a 50 mm parallel plate of the rheometer with a 0.8 mm gap by adding   1.6 mL of the precursor solution containing Fmoc-F (10 mM) and FF-Dopa (20 mM) after adding   0.4 mL of W-NC. Dynamic time sweeps were carried out with a strain amplitude of 2% and a   frequency of 2 Hz at 37  o C. In addition, the rheology of the obtained hydrogel before and after   injection was also compared.           The morphology of the oligopeptide hydrogel was examined by the scanning electron   microscope (SEM) and TEM, respectively. For the SEM characterization, the freeze-dried   hydrogel on the silicon chip was coated with gold and then observed by SEM (Hitachi S3400N)   at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. For the TEM characterization, the hydrogel was dropped   onto a copper grid with 300 mesh, followed by 1.5 min of staining with the phosphotungstic acid   (2%, v:v). After air-drying, the sample was observed by TEM (Hitachi HT7700) at an   accelerating voltage of 80 kV.           The time-dependent formation of the oligopeptide hydrogel was analyzed by the high-  pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). 7  The HPLC system (Shimadzu) consisted of two LC-  20AD pumps, an SIL-20AC auto sampler, a CTO-20AC column oven, and an SPD-M20A diore   array detector was employed to quantify the protease-assisted conversion from precursors to   gelators.

A universal mechanical tester (Instron, 5965, USA) was employed for uniaxial elongation   measurements. The rectangular-shaped samples (length = 30 mm, width = 6 mm, thickness = 2   mm) of hydrogels were fixed with two clamps, and the loading rate was 60 mm min-1. Five PEP-  AG samples with different AG content (0, 0.25 wt%, 0.5 wt%, 0.75 wt%, 1 wt%) were tested. The   tensile strength and the extension ratio at break were recorded. Each sample was tested for three   specimens.   Equilibrated swelling ratios (ESR).    The equilibrated swelling ratios was measured as previously reported.1 Each sample had the   same shape and size, and all the samples were incubated at 10 mL PBS (pH = 7.4) at 37 °C. After   predetermined times, the samples were taken out and superficial water was removed by filter   papers. The weights were recorded until reaching the equilibrated state. ESR was calculated by   using the following equation: ESR = (Wt-Wi)/Wi×100%, where Wi and Wt represented the initial   weight of the wet hydrogel and the weight after swelling equilibrium, respectively. All tests were   repeated three times.   Degradation performance in vitro.    The in vitro degradation performance was evaluated as previously reported.2 The in vitro   degradation performance of PEP-AG was investigated in PBS (pH = 7.4). PEP-AG samples with   different AG content (0, 0.25 wt%, 0.5 wt% and 0.75 wt%) were cut into small pieces   (approximately 50 mg at the initial weight), and each sample was immersed into 20 mL PBS at 37   °C and maintained in a thermostat incubator with a shaking speed of 60 rpm. At each preset time   point (0, 5, 15, and 20 days), the remaining hydrogels were collected, lyophilized and weighed.

As a control, hydrogels were also   soaked in Dex 0.1 mM solution without any pDA treatment. Subsequently, the hydrogels were   frozen at -80°C, freeze-dried and sputter coated with gold. The elementary composition of the   hydrogel’s surface was characterized by energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy to evaluate   the adsorption of Dex.   To verify the retention of Dex on the hydrogel coated with pDA, 200 µL a solution of Dex-FITC   (7.75 µg/mL) was placed on the gels fabricated on the bottom of a 96 well plate (100 µL/well). As a   control, the same study was carried out on gels without any pDA coating. The fluorescence intensity   of Dex-FITC was measured before and after the process of adsorption. The experiment was   conducted for one hour in the dark at 37°C. The fluorescence was evaluated by using an excitation   wavelength of 493 nm and by recording the emission wavelength at 519 nm. Dex-FITC was chosen   instead of Dex to avoid the interference caused by the absorption of Irgacure 2959 in the UV   region.  Once the amount of Dex-FITC has been evaluated, the hydrogels were washed every 24   hours with 200 µL of fresh DPBS, and the fluorescence was monitored over a period of 120 hours.   The quantity of Dex-FITC remaining on the gels was indirectly calculated based on the fluorescence   intensity measured from the different washes and determined by a calibration plot of Dex-FITC in   DPBS ranging from 0.39 µg/mL up to 25 µg/mL.

The diameter of   the gels was measured using a caliper, while the height was obtained directly using the RSA-III. All   mechanical testing was performed on the swollen hydrogels, and the compression probes were   lubricated with mineral oil both to minimize gel drying during the test.

Frequency sweep in the range from 0.01 up to 10 Hz were recorded for all samples at 37°C in the   viscoelastic region at 1% of strain. Preliminary strain sweep tests were carried out in the range of   0.1 up to 100% of strain to define the range of viscoelastic region. The hydrogels with the different   concentration of GelMA or different concentration of calcium chloride (0.1 mM up to 10 mM) (1.0   cm in diameter and 0.5 cm height, n=3) were tested using a 25 mm serrated steel plate-plate   geometry, and a water trap was placed on the geometry to avoid excessive evaporation during the   test. Strain sweeps in the range of 1 to 300% of strain were carried out at 1 Hz to evaluate the   maximum yield strain (n=3).

It can be found that the conductivity increases significantly with the addition of   aniline, while the fracture stress, fracture strain, and fracture energy decrease. The   main reason is that the polyaniline molecular chain contains a large number of   benzene rings, showing a rigid structure. It will hinder the movement of molecular   chains and reduce the mechanical properties. In addition, although the mechanical   strength decreased, the Young's modulus of the gel slightly increased with the amount   of aniline, which was also due to the rigid ring structure of polyaniline.

Synthesis of ABA tri-block copolymer NON.   Hydrogel Fabrication   The hydrogels or polymer solutions were prepared by facilely dissolving the corresponding copolymers into PBS buffer at 4  o C under stirring, and reached to a final polymer concentration of 10.0 wt%. The generated bubbles was removed under vac-  uum or stored at 4  o C for 24 hours. After that, the polymer solution was heated to 37   o C for hydrogelation. For the investiga-  tion of quadruple hydrogen bonding interactions, the UNONU copolymer was dissolved into a 5 mol/L of urea solution in-  stead of PBS buffer.   Characterization   The characterization of the monomer and copolymer.   The chemical structure of the synthetic monomer and copolymer was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1 H NMR)   (600 MHz, Bruker, Switzerland), CDCl3 was used as the deuterium solvent for all synthetic chemicals. Differential scanning   calorimeter (DSC) was employed to characterize the thermal properties of PEG445, copolymers UNONU and NON, in which   the tests were carried out between 10  o C and 80   o C with a heating or cooling rate of 10   o C/min. The molecular weight of   synthetic copolymer were characterized on a gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and  1 H NMR, and the detailed result   was shown in Table S1.    The characterization of the hydrogel   Dynamic Light Scattering study (DLS): The hydrodynamic diameters of the copolymer (UNONU and NON) at different   temperatures between 4-40 °C were measured using a Zetasizer (Malvern, Zetasizer Nano ZSP) with a polymer concentra-  tion of 0.1 mg/mL. The temperature where a deep increase of particle size occurred was determined as the lower critical solu-  tion temperature (LCST) of the copolymer. UV-Vis spectrometry: For characterization of the stability of UPy based hydrogel,   UV-Vis absorption spectra of a UNONU solution (1 mg/ml) at room temperature under air atmosphere were recorded for 7   days using a UV-Vis spectrometer (U-3010, Hitachi, Japan).   Rheological test of the hydrogels.      The rheological properties of the fabricated hydrogels were measured on an ARG-2 rheometer (TA instruments, United   States). Stainless steel parallel plates with diameter of 40 mm were employed for the test of all hydrogels and the gap be-  tween plates was set at 1 mm. For the convenience of tests, all hydrogel samples were prepared into disc-shapes with two   glass plates at 37  o C and waited for 10 minutes for completed gelation, while fixing the gap at 1 mm. For the strain-sweep   test, dynamic strain amplitude cyclic test, frequency-dependent oscillatory shear rheology and the viscosity measurement, the   temperature was fixed at 37  o C with a hydrogel polymer concentration of 10.0 wt% and silicone oil was used to prevent water   evaporation. For oscillatory strain amplitude sweep measurements, the frequency was kept at 1 rad/s while the strain was   raised from 0.1% to 500%. For the characterization of self-healing properties, dynamic step strain amplitude test was per-  formed between 0.5% and 200% for five cycles while keeping the angular frequency at the constant of 1 rad/s. The frequen-  cy-dependent oscillatory shear rheology was also measured from 0.01 rad/s to 100 rad/s (strain = 0.5%). To achieve the vis-  cosity variation of self-healing hydrogel under different shear rates, viscosity measurement was conducted by controlling   shear rate varying from 0.1~100 rad/s. To investigate the thermo-sensitive sol-gel transition behavior of the prepared hydro-  gel, temperature sweep experiments were conducted within the range of 4-37  o C on a 10.0 wt% hydrogel (strain = 0.5%).

As can be seen, the naked conductive hydrogel   fiber loses most of water (~50.43 wt%) in the first two days and continues declining slowly, whilst the core-  shell conductive fiber only loses ~1.65 wt% of water after ten days of storage. This effect can be further   enhanced by coating a thin parylene layer on the outer surface of shell layer. 1   ","=HYPERLINK(""sem/10.1021_acsami.9b20612\supp_4.jpg"",""sem/10.1021_acsami.9b20612\supp_4.jpg"")"

The mixture of γ- PGA-ADH and γ-PGA-GMA was rapidly mixed with the HA-CHO solution in a vial. The time  until the mixtures don’t flow was considered as the gelation time. This test was carried out in  triplicate.  The swelling behaviors of IPN hydrogels were studied by the following steps: (1) the IPN  hydrogels (300 μL) were prepared in a cylinder mold and then immersed in PBS solution at 37°C.  At different intervals, the swollen IPN hydrogels were taken out and removed the surface water,  then weighed (Ws) immediately; (2) the prepared IPN hydrogels (300 μL) were lyophilized and  weighed (Wd). The swelling ratio was expressed as (Ws-Wd)/Wd and this test was carried out three  times.  Microporous morphologies of the lyophilized hydrogels were examined by scanning electron  microscopy (SEM, Hitachi, SU1510, Japan). Firstly, the hydrogels prepared in a cylinder mold  were frozen at -80°C and vacuum lyophilized at -50°C for 48 h, then the lyophilized hydrogels  were broken off and the cross-sectionals were gold coated and observed by SEM.   To test the enzymatic degradation of hydrogels, the hydrogel samples were prepared in a  cylinder mold then lyophilized and weighed (W0). The dried hydrogels were incubated in PBS  solution with 0.1 mg/mL of hyaluronidase and 0.25 mg/mL of papain at 37 °C. Sample in PBS  without enzyme was used as blank. At predetermined intervals, the hydrogels were taken out and  lyophilized to obtain the dried mass (Wt). The solution was replaced every time with a fresh  solution. This experiment was performed in triplicate and the degree of degradation was defined  as: Weight remaining (%) = (Wt/W0) ×100%  Thermo gravimetry analysis (TGA) measurements of HA-GMA, γ-PGA-GMA and HA/γ-PGA  hydrogel were performed using a thermogravimetry instrument (HENGJIU, HCT-2, China) under  nitrogen atmosphere. The temperature range was set as 35~700°C, and the heat rate was 10 °C/min.  Rheological measurements were carried out with an Anton Paar rheometer (MCR302) using a  25 mm plate-plate sensor. The linear viscoelastic regions of hydrogel samples were determined by  Strain sweep at 1 Hz. The viscoelastic behaviors of hydrogels were evaluated via oscillatory  frequency sweeps which were performed at a fixed strain of 1% at 25°C.  The compressive properties of hydrogels were studied by unconfined compression tests using a  universal material testing instrument (MTS, CMT2103, USA). Firstly, hydrogels (500 μL) were  prepared in a 1 cm diameter cylindrical mold. Then the compression test was carried out at a  controlled rate 10 mm/min. The cyclic compression test was performed by undergoing 5 cycles of  compression. The compressive modulus was determined using the slope of the initial linear region  of stress-strain curves.

The hybrid gel was cut by using a   laser cutting system [VLS 3.50, ULS], resulting specimens in a size of 76 mm × 25 mm × 3 mm   (width × length × thickness).

The stretching rate was 6 min-1 and   the polymer ratio of the hybrid gel was 32 %. The pH of as-prepared hybrid gel was approximately   4.4, so swelling of the gels in PBS buffer induced the increase in pH of the gel.

Then, the successive loading-unloading compressive tests were   conducted for ten cycles without intervals between consecutive cycles. The dissipated   energies were calculated from the area between loading-unloading curves. The   recovery ratio was defined by a ratio of energy dissipation after each cycle to the   initial cycle.    To investigate the mechanical performance of the hydrogels at low-temperature   conditions, the samples were incubated under −60, −40, −20, and 0 °C for over 24 h.   Then, the mechanical performance of these samples under different conditions was   immediately examined after the samples were taken out. The ultra-low temperature of   −60 and −40 °C was achieved via an ultra-low freezer (Thermo Scientific Forma 900).       4. Adhesion test   The adhesion strength was determined by the lap-shear test using a universal test   machine (Zwell/Roell). A piece of the hydrogel was cut into 25 mm × 25 mm sample   and sandwiched between two substrates that were fixed to a glass slide (2 mm of   thickness) using double coated tapes. After preloaded by 1kg weight for 10 min, the   specimens were tested by the standard lap-shear test at a velocity of 10 mm min−1   under ambient conditions. The adhesion strength was calculated by dividing the   maximum force by the adhesion area. Additionally, the adhesion-strip cyclic tests   were also conducted to evaluate the effect of a cycle load on the adhesion strength of   the hydrogels. The long-term adhesiveness was characterized as a function of storage   time on the adhesion strength of the hydrogels.   For temperature-resistant adhesion, the hydrogels were initially sandwiched by the   substrates (Zn-carbon and pigskin) and then incubated under −60, −40, −20, 0 and   25 °C for over 24 h. At least three parallel samples were tested for each group.      5. Evaluation of Anti-freezing and long-term moisture-retention ability   The freezing point of hydrogels was determined by using a differential scanning   calorimeter (Q2000, TA Instruments) scanning from −80 °C to 50 °C at a scan rate of   10 °C min–1, with the samples (10 mg) kept in an Al pan. The hydrogel samples (2 cm   in diameter and 1.5 cm in height) were stored in a 25 ℃ thermostat with 50%   relatively humidity (RH) for 120 days. The weight change was calculated by Weight   ratio = Wt/W0 × 100%, where Wt and W0 was the weight of the hydrogel at time t and   the initial weight of the hydrogel, respectively.

In term of molecular structure, negatively sulfonate groups and positively charged   quaternary ammonium groups existed on PZHEs, providing the ion migration channel   for transporting Zn2+ and Cl−, which thereby homogenized the ion distribution and   achieved the uniform zinc deposition. Furthermore, the abundant hydrophilic and   charged groups in the zwitterionic polymer and the concentrated ZnCl2 in the water-  in-salt type PZHEs could well immobilize water molecules in the polymer skeleton,   which thus reduced side reactions and corrosion. In addition, the presence of Cl− ions   might facilitate the desolvation of [ZnCl]+(H2O)n–1 (with n = 1–6) clusters, which   subsequently enabled more efficient charge storage in carbon electrodes. The above   three points synergistically endowed the as-built ZIHCs based on water-in-salt type   PZHEs with a ultralong cycling life and a high coulombic efficiency.

The   product was then incubated at 50 °C overnight to remove unreacted AA. For each   measurement, 100 mL liquid was poured into a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask. The   Erlenmeyer flask was cleaned and completed dried prior to each measurement. A   stopper with a glass tube was immediately plugged into the mouth of flask after PAA   solution was added and the manometer was connected to the glass tube with a rubber   tube. Each measurement took at least 10 min to allow the system to reach equilibrium.   The saturated vapor pressure of DI water was also measured using the same procedure.   Fall cone test. The shear strength of soil crust was measured by placing the sample   underneath the cone holder (Geonor fall cone apparatus), with the tip of a cone touching   the sample. After releasing the cone from the magnet holder, the penetration depth was   read from the graded window. The number was then compared with a reference table to   determine the shear strength.   Unconfined compressive strength test. The unconfined compressive strength of soils   stabilized by PAA containing solutions was measured by a compression machine (GCTS   STX-050 pneumatic cyclic triaxial system). Soil columns were prepared by pouring F-  60 sand and aqueous soil stabilizers (t-AA and/or EICP) into a plastic tube to make   approximate 2” (diameter)×5” (height) columns. The columns were then pressed under a   constant rate of 0.5% axial strain per minute and the corresponding pressure was   recorded. Each recipe of soil stabilizer was tested 3 times to reduce measurement error.   Accelerated weathering test. Accelerated weathering test was carried out in an   environmental chamber (QUV Accelerated Weathering Tester). The chamber was kept   at 60 °C with a UV irradiation intensity of 31.74 W/m 2 . Soil samples treated with t-AA   and/or EICP solutions were placed in the environmental chamber and their shear   strength was estimated by fall cone experiments at 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 days. Pure PAA   hydrogels were used for FTIR characterizations to reduce interference from soil IR   absorptions. PAA hydrogels were prepared by baking t-AA at 40 °C. To study the   influence of pH on PAA stabilities, the amount of NaOH in t-AA was varied among 0 g,   0.996 g and 1.992 g to get PAA hydrogels with pristine carboxyl groups, partially   deprotonated carboxyl groups and carboxylate groups, respectively.

Meanwhile, the speed of   UV degradation is linearly proportional to the UV intensity. Therefore, the equivalent   aging time under given environmental conditions can be estimated based on specific   weather information. For example, with the average UV irradiation of 28 MJ·m -2  ·month -1     and the average high temperature of 40.6 °C during summer in the  Phoenix, AZ area,   the   UV and thermal induced decomposition was accelerated by 34.6 times and 4.7 times in   the accelerated weathering test.   The results from our aging tests showed that PAA   hydrogels should be stable for at least 3 months even in the most extreme weather, which   is sufficiently long for most surficial applications, e.g. dust mitigation at construction   sites/mine sites and setting up temporary roads.

During the tests,   the hybrid membranes were nipped in two cells with different concentration solution   (KCl or NaCl), and the electrodes were a pair of Ag/AgCl. The effective area of the   tests was approximately 3 × 104 μm2. All the membranes before testing were immersed   in DI water for 24 hours.      1.4 Permeation Experiments   Two type of fluorescent dye solution with opposite charges (rhodamine 6G or   sulforhodamine solution) was prepared to assess the ion permeation of membranes.   Both concentrations of dye solution were 0.1 mM. During the test, membrane was   nipped in the same electrochemical device with I-V measurement to separate   fluorescent dye solution and DI water, and hot stage heating (25℃) and magneton   stirring were needed. The fluorescence intensity of the water in cell B was measured by   spectrofluorophotometer (RF-5301PC, SHIMADZU, Japan) every 5 minutes, and the   permeability of dyes can be obtained after conversion according to the standard curve   of the strength of fluorescent dye. The standard curve of the strength of fluorescent dye   was obtained by measuring the fluorescence intensity of the dye with different and   known concentrations. Then curve fitting was performed by Origin, and the standard   curve was obtained.      1.5 Mechanical Measurements   The tensile test was performed by a tensile-compressive tester (M5-2), the pulling rate   was 10 mm/min in air. The tear test was also performed by the tensile-compressive   tester (M5-2), and the pulling rate was 20 mm/min in air. The fracture energy G was   calculated by equation: G = 2F/s, where F was the average force, s was the sample’s   thickness. Friction test was performed by using the Friction and Wear Testing Machine   (UMT TriboLab, Bruker) with a cone type aluminum trioxide sensor (d = 1 mm), the   compressive stress on the membrane surface was 10 mN and the moving speed of   sensor was 1 mm/s.

Different effects of space charge and surface charge are theoretically investigated using   a software package Ichannel1 with incorporation of non-standard finite element bases,2   which is a MPI-OpenMp parallel 3D finite-element-method (FEM) Poisson-Nernst-  Planck (PNP) solver developed by Lu’s group based on the open source finite element   toolbox Parallel Hierarchical Grid (PHG).1 The Poisson-Nernst-Plank (PNP)   equations3-4 describe the permeation process through a channel using a continuum   modeling of ion concentrations and electrostatic potentials. The Poisson equation   determines the electrostatic field induced by the charge distribution containing mobile   charges in the solvent region, space charge in the channel region, and surface charge on   the surface of the channel. The NP equation is a current density equation used to model   the flow of ions driven by their concentration gradients and the electric field.

Schematic showing possible structural scenarios during network deformation in PLU8-LRD8 hydrogels. Covalent cross-linking of polymer chains leads to the formation of an elastic network, whereas physical cross-linking between Laponite and polymer chains induces viscoelastic properties. Before deformation, preferentially PPO polymer chains are attached to the LRD surfaces. During deformation, polymer chains are stretched, “unfolded” and rearranged. During this process the physical cross-linking may rearrange with attaching and detaching polymer chains. This rearrangement leads to finer hydrogel structures and smaller pore sizes at high elongations.","=HYPERLINK(""sem/10.1021_ma200562k\ma-2011-00562k_0009.jpeg"",""sem/10.1021_ma200562k\ma-2011-00562k_0009.jpeg"")"

The ratio of TA to LS has an important influence on the antibacterial activity of the soaking   agent TA@LS-Ag. In the case of TA only, the soaking agent TA-Ag performed no antibacterial   activity because of the aggregation of TA. However, the antibacterial activity obviously   improved after adding LS, demonstrating LS acted as a dispersant in TA@LS-Ag. Both the   soaking agents LS-Ag and TA@LS exhibited a certain antibacterial activity resulted from the   reducibility of LS and TA, which could reduce silver ions into silver nano particles in system.   Excessive TA@LS-Ag (4/1) or deficiency amounts TA@LS-Ag (1/2) of TA reduced the   antibacterial activity of the soaking agent, the best ratio is TA@LS-Ag (2/1). The data in Table   S1 suggested the TA played the role of reducing agent in TA@LS-Ag, and LS played the role of   reducing agent and dispersant.  Table S2.

Briefly,   CS-nb (4 w:v% in 0.1 w:v% IRG – 2% AcOH) and Col (1 w:v% in 2% AcOH) were combined   with the desired crosslinker and diluted with 0.1 % IRG in 2% AcOH to a final composition of   2 w:v% CS-nb and 0.25 w:v% Col. The mixture was homogenised and cured with UV-A or   UV-B for the desired period of time, typically varied between 10 sec and 15 min.   2.5 Swelling ratio  Hydrogel samples were realised by curing 200 µL of the precursor solution in a centrifuge   plastic tube (2 mL) with UV B for 10 min. The resulting hydrogels were lyophilised and the   dried mass, wd, was recorded. Freeze-dried samples were immersed in the desired solution (DI   water, PBS, or DI water with pH adjusted to 3 or 11 with 0.1 M HCl or NaOH). The samples   were swelled for 7 days, after which the excess of liquid was wiped with filter paper and the   mass of the swollen hydrogel, ws, was recorded.

Transmittance was measured in the range of 200   and 900 nm with deionized water as reference for 100% transmittance.    Refractive index: Refractive index of lenses was measured using Mettler Toledo Refracto 30P,   hand-held refractometer. The device determines the refractive index by measuring the critical   angle of total reflection of a light beam of 589.3 nm falling on the sample. Calibration was   performed before each measuring sequence with water at room temperature. The range of the   instrument is between 1.32 and 1.50 with a resolution of 0.0001 and an accuracy of ± 0.0005.   Contact angle: The contact angle was measured using Dino lite digital microscope   (Netherlands) and analyzed by Dino capture 2.0 software. A drop of water was placed on to   the surface of hydrogel after allowing it to stand for 2 minutes. The droplet was dispensed   using an intravenous needle and a disposable syringe mounted on a laboratory stand. The   image was captured from the video of the experiment.   Mechanical properties: Prior to the test the specimens were kept immerged in water. The   samples were tested instantly after being removed from the water to limit effects due to   dehydration of the hydrogel. The room temperature was 23 °C (±2 °C). Tensile tests were   performed using a laboratory tensile test machine (Shimadzu). The machine was equipped   with a 10 N load cell. The specimens were tested at a cross-head speed of 10 mm/min. A   polarized light source of hexagonally arrayed LEDs was used to detect strain-induced   birefringence due the reorientation of CNC whiskers in the hydrogel during stretching. For   polarized light photography, cross head speed of 50 mm/min was used and polarizers were set   parallel and perpendicular to the direction of strain. Experimental set up is shown in Fig 1.

Strain sweep between 0.01 and 10 % at 1 Hz   frequency and 25 °C was performed to locate the linear viscoelastic region. Frequency scans   between 1 and 100 Hz at 25 °C isothermal conditions were then carried out. The applied   strain was 0.25 %, and the force at the contact between plate and sample was set to 5 N.   Oxygen permeability: The measurements were performed using Ox-Tran 2/21 Mocon   instrument equipped with a coulometric detector. The measurements were performed at 37   °C. The relative humidity was maintained between 94 and 100%. Synthetic air (20.9% O2 and   79.1% N2) was used throughout study. The sample was conditioned for 16 hours prior to test   to outgas dissolved oxygen. The sample was 1 mm in thickness, and the exposure area was 5   cm 2 . The sample was fixed between aluminum masks using Epiglu  TM  glue, to avoid leakage.   The measurement was performed in duplicate. The underlying principle of the measurement is   described in detail in ASTM F1927 – 07,   Standard Test Method for Determination of   Oxygen Gas Transmission Rate, Permeability and Permeance at Controlled Relative Humidity   Through Barrier Materials Using a Coulometric Detector.   Suturing: Suturing procedure was performed at Griffith’s lab at Linköping University. To   determine if implants are amenable to suturing for retention of the implant during surgery,   implants were subjected to suture testing. The implants were cut out with a circular trephine   to a diameter of 6.75 mm and a circular corneal button of 6.5 mm dimensions was removed   from an excised porcine cornea to form a wound bed. The implants fit snuggly into the wound   bed and the placement of 12 interrupted sutures was used to determine the ability of the   construct to tolerate suture placement. Implants were scored from “0” to “3”, from no   observable effect on the hydrogel to tearing of the hydrogel, respectively, for each suture.   Then, a total score for all sutures was summed for each of the triplicate sample. An arbitrary   threshold value for suturability was set at “10” based on the total score for each sample.

S7      Instrumentation   Uniaxial compressive and tensile tests were performed using a universal tensile machine   (UTM) (MCT-2150, A&amp;D, Japan) with a 500-N load cell at 25 °C in air. Cylindrical or   film hydrogels were prepared for the compressive or tensile measurements, respectively   (for compressive test: diameter × height, 15 mm × 10 mm; for tensile test: width × length   × thickness, 10 mm × 40 mm × 1 mm). The film samples were glued between two acrylic   clamps using a superglue for the testing. The hydrogel samples were elongated at a rate of   10 mm min-1 until broken, and then, the stress–strain curves were recorded in triplicate.   Young's modulus was obtained from the initial slope of the stress–strain curves (strain, 0–  10%) from three independent samples, and toughness was also estimated from the area   under the curves. Those values were presented with average and standard deviation.    Morphology of dried hydrogels was observed using a JSM-7500F scanning electron   microscope (SEM) at an accelerating voltage of 1 kV. Before the measurement, the sample   was dried using a lyophilizer and coated with a thin platinum layer at an accelerating   current of 10 mA for 60 sec.

The ethanol-impregnated sample was then removed from the cylinder and the   residue ethanol volume was recorded as V3. The porosity (ε) of the hydrogel sample was obtained   by eq. (2). The data were averaged from five independent measurements.    100% (2)  3.7 Determination of the amount of gelatin adsorbed within hydrogel    The gelatin concentration in the precursor solution was fixed at 1.5% in this study as described   in section 2.2 and 2.3. After the photo-induced cross-linking copolymerization, the gel obtained   was dialyzed (MWCO 3000) in deionized water at 37 °C to allow the release of unadsorbed gelatin   as well as DMSO and salt porogen from the gel. The unadsorbed gelatin in the aqueous solution   that remained inside the dialysis bag was concentrated and measured using a bicinchoninic   acid (BCA) protein assay. The amount of gelatin adsorbed within hydrogel was obtained by   subtracting the unadsorbed gelatin from the total gelatin in the precursor solution employed for   hydrogel fabrication. The data were averaged from three independent measurements.   3.8 Test of the leaching of gelatin from hydrogels        The leaching of gelatin from the hydrogels (BP-M1, BP-M3, BP-L1, and BP-L3) to aqueous   buffer could be measured by incubating 0.5 ~ 0.6 g of different hydrogel samples (containing 2.5   mg of adsorbed gelatin) in 10 mL of phosphate buffer solution (0.1 M, pH 7.4). Then the released   amounts of gelatin from different hydrogels were measured using the BCA protein assay. After   48h incubation at 37 °C, 25 μL of leaching solution was added to 200 μL of the BCA working   solution and the absorbance at 562 nm was measured. At the same time, the 25 μL of gelatin   standard solution (with 0.25 mg mL-1 concentration) was treated with the same procedure. The   weight ratios of gelatin released from BP-M1, BP-M3, BP-L1, and BP-L3 hydrogels, respectively,   were obtained by comparing their absorbance at 562 nm. The data were averaged from three   independent measurements.   3.9 Mechanical tests   The compressive measurements of the hydrogels were performed on a FR-103C testing machine   (Farui Co., China) at a crosshead speed of 1 mm min-1. The cylindrical gel samples were 10 mm in   diameter and 7 – 8 mm in thickness.

All the samples were equilibrated in deionized water before measurement.   The engineering compressive stress (σ) was calculated as σ = Load/πR2, where R is the original   radius of the specimen. The engineering strain (ε) under compression is defined as the change in   the thickness relative to the original thickness of the freestanding specimen. The stress and strain   between ε = 0 and 10% were used to calculate the initial compressive modulus (E). The   compressive toughness was calculated as: [3]     .

Temperature was controlled to ± 0.1 °C with a thermal controller (SC150-A10) for RS6000. The   hydrogel sample in a fully swollen state was cut into disk shape with diameter 20 mm and   thickness 2 mm. Frequency sweep experiment was carried out to measure the storage modulus (G’)   and loss modulus (G’’) as a function of angular frequency (ω, 1-100 rad s-1). The strain amplitude (γ)   was fixed at 1% as it has been found to be well within the linear strain amplitude response regime.   The strain recovery experiment was performed with at least 5 cycles of strain steps of 0.1% and   100% strain, each at an angular frequency of 6.28 rad s-1 (1 Hz).   3.12 Friction measurement   The friction behavior of hydrogels against a hydrophilic glass surface (contact angle to pure   water, θw = 50 º) in supplemented DMEM/F-12 cell culture medium or in HA aqueous solution   was measured using a strain-controlled rheometer (ARES-2K FRT, Rheometric Scientific) that   works in a constant compressive strain mode at 25 °C.[10] The hydrogel samples (thickness 3 ~ 3.5   mm, diameter 12 mm) were soaked in testing media for one week before measurement. Steady rate   sweep test mode measurements were performed after the normal pressure (15 kPa) was applied for   15 min.

The spectra were run in Cary WinUV software and the data were analyzed by Oringin 9.0.   The processes of H-1 being fully degraded by poly(ethylene glycol) diamine and poly(ethylene glycol)   dithiol (Mn = 2,000) were characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy. The 100 uL poly(ethylene glycol)   diamine and poly(ethylene glycol) dithiol (500mg/mL) were respectively added to 200 uL H-1 and the   concentration of the newly generated product was recorded.   1.2.7 Rheological test and Equilibrium Swelling Analyses  The rheological properties of the hydrogels 1-4 were tested by an Anton Paar rheometer (MCR302,   Austria). The storage module G’ and loss module G’’ were tested with an 8 mm plate and the temperature   was 37 ℃. In addition, the Young’s modulus was related to the storage modulus (G') by the following   equation: E = G' * 2 (1 + ) where E was the Young’s modulus and  was the Poisson’s ratio.1 The elastic   responses of H-2 &amp; 3 were analyzed by a strain amplitude sweep method.2 The gel transformation process   was monitored by the time sweep carried out at a strain of 1% and the frequency of 1 Hz. Amplitude   oscillatory strains were switched from low strain (1.0%) to high strain (200% / 500%), with each time   interval of 30 s, and repeated three cycles. The dynamic strain amplitude cycle (γ = 0.1% to 200%) was   also measured to detect the critical strain region.

Afterwards, the dried hydrogels   were sprayed with gold and observed. The cross section of hydrogels and morphologies of the cells on   the hydrogel surfaces were characterized by a scanning electron microscope (SEM, MAIA3 LMH, USA).  1.2.9 Statistical analysis of the pore diameter of hydrogels  The pore diameter of the hydrogels was analyzed by the SEM images.

Maleimide groups are measured by using their light   absorption at 310 nm under UV spectroscopy.         Table S1.

Reason for choosing 1% strain in rheological measurement  The 1% strain was chosen for the frequency sweep tests according to the previous researches, since   1%–5% is a frequently-used range for testing the hydrogels for cell culture.1-4 The strain sweep   tests were not performed in this study, because the results of the previous publication showed that   similar dextran hydrogels could keep in the linear viscoelastic region under over 10% strain.5 The   components used in that publication (maleimide-functionalized dextran solution with 30 mM   maleimide groups; thiol-functionalized cross-linker solution with 20 mM thiol groups) were   almost the same to ours. Additionally, the concentration of the components (e.g. 2.3–7.5 mM   cross-linker) selected in that publication almost covered ours (2–4 mM cross-linker). Therefore,   we inferred that the hydrogels tested in this study were also in the LVR under 1% strain.

The compressive stresses varying 1   with strains were measured by a tensile-compressive tester (FR-108B, Farui Co., 2   China). The shapes of gel samples were cylindrical, with approximately 16 mm in 3   diameter and 10 mm in height. The compressive deformation was increased from 0 % 4   to 95 % at a rate of 1.0 mm⋅min -1  . The values of Young’s modulus were calculated in 5   the strain interval of 5 % to 15 %. The data were averaged from three independent 6   runs. 7   Measurements of the temperature dependence of swelling ratios. The effect of 8   temperature on the swelling ratio was studied at the temperature ranges from 25 °C to 9   50 °C. The equilibrium swelling ratio is defined to be the maximum of swelling ratio, 10   which could be obtained after 24 h swelling at the used temperature. After immersed 11   in distilled water at a given temperature, the gel sample was removed from the 12   distilled water and weighed after wiping off the excess water from the surface of the 13   sample. Following the similar treatment process, the gel was re-equilibrated in 14   distilled water at another temperature and its wet weight was measured thereafter. The 15   mass of the dry gel sample can be determined after drying it in a vacuum oven at 50 16   °C for 24 h until weight of the gel constancy. The swelling ratio (SR) was calculated 17   as equation (1) and the data were averaged from five independent runs for each 18   sample。 19   −−−− S d  d  W W S R =  W                      (1) 20    where Ws and Wd represent the weights of swollen gel at temperature t and dry gel, 21   respectively. 22   Measurements of the shrinking kinetics at temperature above LCST. The 23   shrinking kinetics of the gels was measured gravimetrically at 50 °C in which the gels 24   can dramatic shrink within a short time. The gel samples were firstly immersed in 25   distilled water at room temperature until the swell equilibrium was reached with the 26   mass recorded as Ws. The resulting gel samples were then quickly transferred into a 27   water bath at 50 °C. At specified time intervals, the samples were took out from the 28   hot water and weighed after wiping off the excess water on the surface by a tissue. 29   Water retention (WR) is expressed as equation (2): 30   −−−−  −−−− ××××  t d  s d  W W WR =  W W 100                 (2)                            31    ","=HYPERLINK(""sem/10.1021_acssuschemeng.6b01691\supp_13.jpg"",""sem/10.1021_acssuschemeng.6b01691\supp_13.jpg"")"

The mechanical properties of  p(AM/DMLB)/ILs-LPs hydrogels (C12) manifested maximal value (tensile stress =  0.49 MPa), indicating that the obtained hydrogels owned a more homogeneous and  stable network structure, and the hydrophobic monomer could associate with ILs-LPs  in the best and optimum way under a large deformation. However, in contrast, the short  hydrophobic chains (C2, C6) were easy to extricate from fragile hydrophobic interaction,  leading to poor tensile strength, while the long ones (C16) brought about invalid tangles  and unfavorable mechanical performance.

After sonicating   the above mixture for 4 hours (Branson Sonifier 450D, 15% in amplitude, 5s on/5s off), we diluted the suspension  to 13 mL and filtered it by 0.22 m filter membrane. After washing it with pure water for 3 times, we suspended  LM-PEP in PBS buffer for storage. The as-prepared LM-PEP was stable for at least 1 month.  Preparation of hybrid hydrogel  We dissolved 5 mg NapFFCYp in 500 L purified water (pH=7.4) to obtain the peptide solution. Two 500 L   mixture (1) 50 L LM-PEP solution (9.0 mg/mL) with 450 L peptide solution (10.0 mg/mL) and (2) 100 L  LM-PEP solution with 400 L peptide solution was stirred for 12 h, separately. The following addition of alkaline  phosphatase (ALP, 100 U/mL) into the above mixtures yielded the hybrid hydrogels after at least 4 hours.  Rheological measurements  We obtained the rheological property of the hybrid hydrogel with Kinexus ultra+ rheometer (Malvern Panalytical   technologies). PU20 rheometer plate was used in this experiment. NapFFCY hydrogel (10 mg/mL, PBS, pH=7.4)  and hybrid hydrogel containing 50μL, 100μL LM-PEP (10 mg/mL, PBS, pH=7.4) were prepared separately before  the test. Rheological measurement was performed 24 hours post adding 100 U ALP into the hybrid nanomaterial  solution. We obtained Gʹ and Gʹʹ values of the above NapFFCY hydrogel and hybrid hydrogel on strain sweep at    ","=HYPERLINK(""sem/10.1021_acsami.0c13334\supp_1.jpg"",""sem/10.1021_acsami.0c13334\supp_1.jpg"")"

Briefly, 3.0 mL of a 8.8 mM PBI1 and 44 mM TEA aqueous   solution were placed on the bottom plate and 360 µL of 4 M HCl were added on top, just before   lowering the top plate and starting data acquisition. However, it was not possible to observe the   sol-gel transition due to immediate hydrogel formation, thus indicating a highly cooperative self-  assembly mechanism. Stress sweeps were conducted at a frequency of 1 Hz to identify the linear   viscoelastic region (see Supporting Information, Fig. S2c). Frequency sweep analysis was   performed at 5 Pa and confirmed independence of both elastic and viscous moduli from the   applied frequency, thus confirming a hydrogel nature of the system (Supporting Information,   Fig. S2d). Measurements were repeated at least twice with time-sweep measurements shown as   average of two datasets.   Oscillatory rheometry analysis of the gelation process (Supporting Information, Fig. S2) shows a   rapid increase in storage modulus G’ up to 3-4 kPa within the first 10 minutes, and then a further   slow increase up to 20 kPa within the first hour. Frequency sweep analysis confirms viscous and   elastic moduli independence from applied frequency, as expected for a hydrogel, while stress   sweep analysis confirms an extended linear viscoelastic regime up to values above 100 Pa of   applied stress. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) of the final gel reveals a remarkably   high gel-to-sol transition temperature with an onset at 83.7 ± 1.0 °C, and an endothermal peak,   corresponding to the melting temperature Tm, at 91.9 °C ± 1.1 °C (Supporting Information, Fig.   S2e).      DIFFERENTIAL SCANNING CALORIMETRY   Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to assess the supramolecular system stability   within a range of temperature values from RT up to 200 °C.

Material’s characterization    Hydrogel formation in a PDMS mold   Solutions of hydrogel precursor (4-arm PEG polymers; concentration = 10 wt %, oxidant NaIO4   concentration = 18 or 36 mM) were freshly prepared in 50 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.5. In a   typical experiment, hydrogels were formed under mild oxidative conditions by mixing 20 wt %   4-Arm PEG-catechol derivatives with the oxidant solution of 36 mM (or 18 mM) NaIO4 in a   polymer: oxidant (1:1) volume ratio. The final composition of the hydrogel was 10 wt % PEG-  catechol (10 or 20 kDa) and 18 mM (or 9 mM) oxidant. Immediately after mixing the two   precursors, the resulting solution (20-100 µL) was quickly poured to the center of a PDMS mold   (1 cm diameter) and incubated in a humidified chamber at 25°C. The hydrogels were let cure in   the incubator for 6 h to achieve complete crosslinking. The obtained hydrogels were kept in   water or PBS for 12-72 h.       Rheological characterization of PEG hydrogels: curing kinetics, degradation kinetics and   shear moduli    To determine the rheological properties and curing kinetics of PEG-catechol based hydrogels,   storage modulus (G′) and loss modulus (G″) were measured using a rotational rheometer (DHR3,   TA Instruments, USA) equipped with a 12 mm parallel plate geometry and a UV/Vis   illumination source connected to the lower plate. A mixture of gel precursors of 40 μL   (containing 20 μL polymer solution and 20 μL oxidant) was placed on the rheometer for the   measurements. An initial measuring gap of 250 μm was set and the experiments were performed   in the dark at strain = 5%, frequency = 1 Hz and controlled temperature of 23°C (Peltier lower   plate). To avoid drying of the sample during testing, paraffin oil was applied around the samples   after setting measuring gap and a metal cap was installed to protect the sample. All rheological   experiments were performed in triplicate. Rheological analysis was also used as a direct   measurement of the PEG hydrogels degradation upon irradiation at λ =365 nm. Hydrogel   samples were prepared on the rheometer as above specified and let cure until G’ reached a   plateau (usually for 250-400 min). The cured gel was subsequently degraded by exposing it to   light irradiation (typically at λ = 365 nm, Irradiance = 10 mW cm-2). Irradiation was performed   either continuously or stepwisely (irradiation pulses of 2-8 min).       Analysis of gelation time as measured by rheology   The gelation time was determined from the time sweep measurements, as the time when G’   overtakes G''. Some representative values of gelation time of PEG-NBt-c formulations are   presented in Table S1.

Analysis of photodegradation kinetics as measured by photorheology    A methodology previously described in the literature6-9 was followed, using as starting point the   results obtained from the time sweep experiments during irradiation. The photodegradation of   the hydrogel was considered to be a first-order kinetic process, therefore the plot of decaying   shear storage modulus was fit to the following equation:   𝐺′(𝑡) = 𝐺′0 𝑒 −𝑘𝑜𝑏𝑠 𝑡   where G’(t) is the shear storage modulus as a function of time, G’0 is the initial shear storage   modulus, and t is the time. This generalization can be utilized to calculate the first-order   degradation rate constant (kobs) by linear regression using the linearized change in storage   modulus over time upon hydrogel light irradiation. To this end, the normalized decay of the   storage modulus, (G’/G’0), as a function of time was plotted and only values of G’(t)   corresponding to 90% to 50% of the initial G’0 were used for calculation of the rate constant. 7   The ln (G’/G’0) was plotted as a function of time. The first-order rate constant (kobs) of the   photodegradation of the network was estimated from the slope of such plot, after a linear fitting   according to the equation:   𝑙𝑛 ( 𝐺′  𝐺′0 ) =  −𝑘𝑜𝑏𝑠𝑡   Analysis of a representative data set is shown as follows.

Adhesion strength measurements on porcine skin   The protocol of adhesion test was adapted from the American Society for Testing and Materials   (ASTM) standard test method F2258-05 (reapproved 2015) to suit our needs, with a Zwick Roell   1446 Universal Testing Machine (UTM, Zwick Roell, Ulm, Germany) equipped with a 200 N   load cell.   Fresh skin from porcine loin was obtained from a local butcher and stored at 4°C for maximum   one week. When needed for the adhesion measurements, a portion of the tissue was covered in   aluminum foil and allowed to reach room temperature for 10 min, placed on a cutting board and   had the underlying fat removed with a scalpel. The tissue obtained, approximate thickness of 3   mm, was cut into disks of 12 mm diameter with a hollow punch, gently cleaned with ethanol and   gauze, and immersed in 50 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.5 until use (within 1-8 h).    For adhesion measurements, skin samples were removed from the buffer, had the excess of   solution gently blotted with tissue paper and the epidermal side was glued to the metal holders of   the UTM using a commercial adhesive (Pattex Superglue Gel Mini Trio, Henkel, Düsseldorf,   Germany) for 10 min.    Precursor solutions of 10 kDa 20 wt% PEG-catechol and 72 mM oxidant (sodium periodate)   were freshly prepared in 50 mM HEPES buffer pH 7.5. These solutions were mixed in 1:1   volume ratio and 25 μL of the curing mixture was quickly pipetted onto the dermal layer of   tissue (final gel composition: 10 wt% PEG-catechol, 36 mM oxidant; gelation time ranged 30 s   to 1 min). This volume was sufficient to uniformly coat the overlap area without significant   overflow. The two tissue samples were approached at a cross-head speed of 3 mm/min until a   load of 0.2 N was reached. Samples were bonded with an applied force of 0.2 N, let cure in the   machine for 30 min at ambient conditions (temperature= 25°C, humidity ca 50%) and then   pulled off to failure at a constant cross-head speed of 2 mm/min.    The tensile adhesion strength was calculated from the maximal of the stress vs. strain curve, as   the maximum stress divided by the bond area. Each measurement was performed six to ten   times.

Tensile adhesion strength of PEG-catechol gels on porcine skin measured by tensile testing.   Final gel composition: 10 kDa 10 wt% PEG-catechol, 36 mM oxidant, in 50 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.5.   Tissue samples were bonded for 30 min at 25°C and then pulled off to failure. Cohesive failure is   indicated by “C“ in both cases. Statistical significance analysis was performed by ANOVA followed by   post-hoc Tukey test (statistical significance set to *p &lt; 0.05). Adhesion strength was 10.3 ± 5.9 kPa for   PEG-NBt-c and 19.4 ± 5.8 kPa for the control PEG-Dop.       Light-triggered debonding of PEG-cat hydrogels from skin tissue   Chicken skin tissue samples were prepared as explained above and PEG-NBt-c, PEG-NDop or   PEG-Dop hydrogels were bonded, then immersed in water in an open square Petri dish and   subjected to light illumination for selected time periods. Illumination conditions: λ= 365 nm,   ECE 2000 standard metal halide UV curing bulb, 400 W, Irradiance = 70 mW cm-2 (DYMAX).   After selected exposure dose, the sample was again immersed in MilliQ water for 5 min and the   stability of the bonded gel layer on the tissue was observed.

(A) Schematic representation of the design strategy for the development of multifunctional nanocomposite hydrogels. DNA–nSi injectable hydrogels are formed via a two-step gelation method. The first step consists of an intermediate weak gel (pregel) formation by heating and subsequent cooling of double-stranded DNA. The denaturation of double-stranded DNA followed by rehybridization in a random fashion facilitates the development of interconnections between adjacent DNA strands (type A network points) via complementary base pairing. Introduction of nSi in the second step of the gelation process increases the number of network points (type B) via electrostatic interaction with the DNA backbone, resulting in a shear-thinning injectable hydrogel. (B) Viscosity vs shear rate plots illustrate an increase in the viscosity due to the presence of nSi. All of the formulations display the typical shearthinning behavior with a reduction in the viscosity as the shear rate increases. (C) Image showing the injection of the blue-colored hydrogel through a 22 G needle.

The Young’s modulus was defined as the slope of   the linear region of the stress- strain curve in the 30-40 % of the strain range (Group   A,C,D and E). For group B, it is in the 5-15 % of the strain range since it cracks at   about 37 % strain. Ultimate stress and ultimate strain values were taken as the point   where failure of the hydrogel occurred.  1.4 Dynamic thermomechanical analysis   The mechanical performance concerning the viscoelastic properties of GG hydrogels   was assessed by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). The viscoelastic measurements   were performed using DMA with the compressive mode. DMA analysis was carried   out in all GG hydrogels with a cylindrical shape of around 8 mm in diameter and 9   mm in thickness at 37 ℃. DMA spectra were acquired during a frequency scan   between 0.1 and 10 Hz. The experiments were performed under constant strain   amplitude. A small preload was applied to each sample to ensure that the entire   surface was under compression. For all hydrogels being tested, the distance between   plates was kept the same. DMA analysis was performed in triplicate (n = 3) for each   condition.  1.5 Morphology characterization  Scanning electron microscopy (SEM ， 2013A532 Quanta 250) was employed to   examine the morphology of the GG hydrogels with an emphasis on the porous   characteristics. Prior to the observation, the hydrogels were frozen in liquid nitrogen   and immediately lyophilized for 48 h.

The quantification was determined by visible light spectrophotometry at   495 nm wavelength, and ultrapure water in 96-well plate was used as a control. S3Five   measurements per condition were performed in triplicate (n = 3).  1.7 Swelling and degradation studies  Swelling and degradation studies were carried out in all GG hydrogels by immersing   them in 5 mL of phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS, Gibco) with 0.025% w/v   NaN3, followed by incubating at 37 ℃ under mild shaking up to 28 days. At day 1, 2,   4, 7, 21 and 28 days, the hydrogels (n = 3) were removed from the solutions and gel   surfaces were quickly blotted on a filter paper and the swelling ratio and degradation   of all GG hydrogels were calculated. Their wet weight was measured（Ws） and   compared to the initial wet weight (Wi) and the weight of freeze-dried hydrogel (Wd)   after swelling or degradation at each time point.

KG, Germany) introduces a movement and on the other   side a load cell (KD24s 10N, ME-Meßsysteme GmbH, Germany) detects a force. To switch   this setup to a tensile test setup a PTFE-sphere with a diameter of 6 mm was mounted to the   moving arm of the stepper motor and a flat PTFE plate was mounted to the load cell. PTFE   was chosen to reduce the friction between the surfaces and the sample.    For the measurement the sphere was moved to a predefined position above the sample.   Afterwards it was lowered 3 mm with a velocity of 0.1 mm/s, resulting in an indentation of   the sample. The indentation depth varied between the samples, because start- and endpoint of   the measurement were predefined and the sample thickness varied.

Photographs of the indenter setup used for the experiments. A) The complete   setup is shown. On the bottom part a PTFE plate is mounted to a load cell to provide a surface   for the indentation test and to measure the introduced force. On the top part a PTFE sphere is   mounted to a stepper motor to introduce an indentation. B) Magnified view of sphere and   surface. The sample is placed on the surface and penetrated by the sphere.      Force and indentation depth data were processed in Matlab R2015a. The mean force of the   first 10% of the data points (far away from the sample) was subtracted from the force-data as   a baseline. The lsqcurvefit function from the Matlab Curve Fitting Toolbox Version 3.5.1 was   used to fit the Hertz Model to the data. The stiffness of the indenter is assumed to be much   higher than that of the sample. By limiting the fitting range successively, we computed how   the measured Young’s modulus (E) changes with depth of indentation. We see a rapid   increase of Young’s modulus followed by a saturation which shows as a plateau in the E vs   distance curve (see Fig. S3). Only E values in this region were assumed to present the samples   properties properly. Hence the Hertz model was used for fitting the data. It is expressed as:    𝐹 = 4𝐸 𝑅  3(1− 𝜐!) 𝛿 − 𝛿!  ! !

Characterization of the hydrogels  For Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis, the hydrogels were   completely dried, and then the FTIR spectra between 1000 and 4000 cm-1 were   obtained from an FTIR spectrometer (Nicolet 560, USA). AQ500 thermogravimetric   analyzer (TG209F1, Germany) was used for thermogravimetric analysis under a dry   N2 atmosphere from 100 to 700 °C at the heating speed of 10 °C/min. And the   cross-section morphologies of the hydrogels and energy dispersive spectra (EDS) were   obtained from a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM-7500F, JEOL, Japan).   Adhesion tests  Different tissues (muscle, spleen, lung, pigskin and kidney) and substrates (rubber,   PP, glass, PU and BOPP) were employed to investigate the adhesion property of the   PAM hydrogel. Tissue samples stored more than 10 min before mechanical tests were   covered with an excess of 0.01% (w/v) sodium azide solution (in PBS) spray and   sealed in plastic bags to prevent degradation and dehydration. All tissues and   engineering solids were adhered by the in-situ formed hydrogels after washing out the   surfaces with PBS followed by 5 seconds of pressing. A digital camera was used to   capture the photos.  To measure shear strength, adhered samples with an adhesion area of width 2.5 cm   and length 1 cm were prepared and tested by the standard lap-shear test (ASTM   F2255) with a mechanical testing machine (SANS CMT4000). All tests were   conducted with a constant tensile speed of 50 mm min−1. Shear strength was   determined by dividing the maximum force by the adhesion area.   Mechanical properties of the hydrogels  The mechanical tensile stress-strain evaluation was carried out by the uniaxial   tensile test employing a universal tensile testing machine (SANS CMT4000) at room   temperature with a constant speed of 1 mm/min under a 1000 N load cell at room   temperature. All the hydrogel samples were prepared into stripes (20 mm in length ×   6 mm in width × 500 μm in thickness).

The test was investigated using a   universal tensile testing machine (SANS CMT4000) with a speed of 5 mm/min at   60% strain and then recovered to 0% strain with a speed of 6 mm/min. This cycle was   repeated 20 times to determine the compressive and recovery properties.   Self-healing and adhesive performances of the hydrogels  The orbiculate hydrogels (diameter = 2 cm) were prepared. Firstly, the hydrogels   were cut into three strips. Then the three strips were put together and placed in a   humidor at room temperature for 2 h. The self-healed hydrogels did not break after   being stretched horizontally.  The adhesive ability of the hydrogels to the host tissue was conducted by using   finger skin. Briefly, the hydrogel was fabricated into a cylindrical shape (5 mm high ×   10 mm in diameter). Then the PAM/SA/Ag (I) hydrogel was adhered to the finger   skin on the one side and adhered to the centrifuge tube (50 g) on the other side.   Blood resource  The blood used in this work was obtained from the West China Medical Center   of Sichuan University, by using standardized blood collection tubes with standardized   operation; and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt was chosen as the   anticoagulant for a systematic blood count assay and contact activation tests; while   sodium citrate was chosen as the anticoagulant for the other blood-related tests. In the   blood test, the blood samples from the same person were used, and three replicates   were used to reduce errors for the blood tests of each sample. The experiments were   approved and performed by West China Hospital, Sichuan University, and all the   experiments were performed in compliance with the relevant laws and national   guidelines (GB/T 16886.4–2003/ISO 10993-4:2002, General Administration of   Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine of the People's Republic of China,   Standardization Administration of the People's Republic of China).

(A) Storage modulus (G′) and loss modulus (G″) of a typical CASP (e.g., 10 mg/mL CASP-K2 in 1× PBS) are responsive to shear strain. As the strain is increased from 1% to 100%, G′ first remains constant (up to approximately 10% strain), then decreases steadily and is exceeded by G′′ at a high strain (>80%). (B) Difference in the storage modulus of CASPs at same peptide molar concentration (10 mg/mL CASP-K2, etc.) and under identical solvent conditions (1× PBS). (C) From CASP-K2 to CASP-K8, the storage modulus at 1% strain and 1 rad/s oscillatory frequency (Go) decreases. (D) The dependence of G′ of a CASP (CASP-K2 in this case) on counterion conditions at different strain values. The multivalent counterion phosphate is more capable than monovalent chloride at inducing gelation, even at similar ionic strength conditions (e.g., 1× PBS versus 150 mM NaCl).

Frequency dependence of the loss tangent (tan δ) (a), storage modulus (G′) and loss  modulus (G″) (b) of the CS/PAA-TA@CNC DN nanocomposite hydrogels with different soaking  times (10, 30 and 60 min).  The shear frequency dependent viscoelastic properties of CS/PAA-TA@CNC DN  nanocomposite hydrogels can be explained by the classic rubber elastic theory, where the network  modulus G of the hydrogels can be calculated by G = Gc + Gp, where Gc and Gp are network modulus  contributed by covalent crosslinks and noncovalent cross-links, respectively. In this respect, the  contribution to network modulus from entangled CS chains is related to the immersion time in NaCl  solution, which is frequency-dependent caused by the stress-relaxation of the entanglement. That is,  the high density of entanglement is, the longer time is required for the entangled chains to pass  through each other and become unraveled. Specifically, at low frequency, the entangled chains can  gradually unravel and hardly contribute to the network modulus, and the G’ is dominated by the  covalent cross-links Gc. However, with the increase of frequency, the chain-entanglement of CS in  the network has no enough time to relax, and both Gc and Gp contribute to the network modulus  thereby.   Rheological Measurements. The storage modulus (G′) and loss modulus (G″) of CS/PAA-TA@CNC DN nanocomposite   hydrogel disks (15 mm in diameter) with different soaking times were tested by a rheometer (TA  AR2000) fitted with parallel plates (15 mm in diameter).

After 16 hours, the samples were deepened in   liquid nitrogen for 10 minutes, then freeze-dried for 24 hours in vacuo (0.2 mBar) at -50 °C.   Morphological Analysis - Scanning electron micrographs of the samples were recorded using a   Zeiss EP EVO 50 field emission gun scanning electron microscope.    Conditions: EHT=20 KeV - Variable Pressure (VP): 100 Pa - Images in secondary electrons (SE)    UV- Vis absorption spectra - UV-Vis absorption spectra (range 200-800nm) are collected by using   an optical path of 0.5cm cuvette at 25 with a Cary300 UV-Vis double beam spectrophotometer,   having an empty cuvette as a reference.   Rheology - Rheology experiments were carried out on an Anton Paar Rheometer MCR 102 using a   parallel plate configuration (25 mm diameter). Experiments were performed at constant   temperature of 23 °C controlled by the integrated Peltier system and a Julabo AWC100 cooling   system. To keep the sample hydrated a solvent trap was used (H-PTD200). Amplitude and   frequency sweep analysis were performed with fixed gap value of 0.5 mm on hydrogel samples   prepared directly on the upper plate of the rheometer once the gelation reaction was completed.   The samples were prepared the day before the analysis and leaved overnight at controlled   temperature of 20 °C to complete the gelation process. Oscillatory amplitude sweep experiments   (γ: 0.01−100%) were carried out to determine the linear viscoelastic (LVE) range at fixed frequency   of 1 rad·s -1  . Once established the LVE of each hydrogel, frequency sweep tests were performed (ω:   0.1-100 rad·s -1  ) at constant strain within the LVE region of each sample. Thixotropic experiments   were conducted on hydrogels 1 (H), 2 (H-T) and 3 (H-TG) by applying consecutive deformation and   recovery steps. The deformation step was performed by applying to the gels a constant strain   above the LVE region of each sample for a period of 7 minutes. The recovery step was performed   by keeping the sample at constant strain within the LVE region for 7 minutes. The cycles were   performed multiple times at fixed frequency of 1 rad/s.

Measurements  Tissue adhesive strength tests Analysis of hydrogels structure. Lap shear tests were   conducted to measure the tissue adhesive strength using a universal test machine with   a crosshead speed of 10 mm/min. Pre-dehydrated porcine skin (in 0.01 M PBS, pH 7.4   for 1 h) slides with a size of 30 mm × 10 mm × 1 mm were used as the adherends. The   hydrogel samples were prepared in situ between the test materials, and the overlap area   was 10 mm × 10 mm × 1 mm. Specifically, the pre-gel mixtures were placed between   the adherends and cured for 5 s with 5N pressure, and then allowed to cure for 60 mins   at 37 °C in calorstat. Three samples for each group (n=3) were used in the lap shear   test. The tests were repeated three times to confirm the reproducibility of the adhesion   strength data. The adhesion strength was calculated using the following equation:  Pa = 𝑁  𝑚2  where N refer to the maximum load (force) and m2 refer to the overlapping contact   area, respectively.  2.

Each wound was covered with sterile gauze and fixed with an   elastic adhesive bandage.   At the 0, 6, 12 and 18 days after the operation, the wounds were recorded using a digital   camera and calculated by Image J software. The residual wound area was calculated by the   following formula: Residual wound area (%) = Sn/S0 × 100% (S0: initial wound area, Sn:   wound area at different time points).  1.2 Histology and immunohistochemical staining  At the 6 and 12 day after the operation, the wound and surrounding tissues were collected and   fixed in 10% paraformaldehyde solution and embedded in paraffin for routine histological   processing. Five-micron thickness sections of the tissues were prepared. According to the   standard protocols, samples were stained with either Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E),   Masson’s trichrome (MT) and anti-CD31 antibody (ARG52748, Arigo).  2. Characterization  2.1 Rheological Tests  Rheological tests of the G-PAGL hydrogel were using a rheometer (TA Discovery, DHR)   fitted with 25 mm diameter parallel plate geometry. Temperature-sweep tests were carried out   at 1 Hz frequency and 0.1% constant strain，  and the samples were first cooled at a rate of   2 °C/min from 60 to -20 °C. The storage modulus (G′), loss modulus (G″), and tan (delta) (tan   δ) were monitored.  2.2 Mechanical Property Measurement  The mechanical properties of the G-PAGL hydrogel were tested on a universal testing   machine (Instron 5944) with a 100 N load cell. For tensile tests, the G-PAGL hydrogel was   made into dumbbell shapes with a length of 40 mm, a gauge length of 12 mm, a width of 5   mm, and a thickness of 1 mm. The stretch rate was fixed at 50 mm/min for the normal tensile   tests and the loading−unloading tensile tests. The stress (σ) was determined as the loading   force divided by the original specimen cross-sectional area, and the strain (ε) was defined as   the deformed length divided by the original length of the samples. The elastic modulus (E)   was calculated according to the initial linear slope of the stress−strain curve.

And then, the mechanical properties and adhesiveness   of the samples in cold or hot conditions were tested immediately after the samples were taken   out from the freezer or oven.  2.4 The Water Retention Analysis  The water retention of the G-PAGL and W-PAGL hydrogel under different temperatures   were observed by putting them into freezer or a container with constant temperature (25 °C   and 60 °C) and humidity (50%) at varying times. The weight of the two hydrogels was   recorded at fixed intervals, and the retained weight (wt.%) was calculated.  To further demonstrate the anti-dehydration and stability of the G-PAGL hydrogel, both the   G-PAGL hydrogel and W-PAGL hydrogel were placed into a freeze-dryer machine for 24 h.   The freezing dry process was under the temperature of -80 °C and the vacuum of &lt;10 Pa. The   properties of the samples were tested after they went through freezing dry process.  2.5 Adhesion Tests of Hydrogels  The universal testing machine (Instron 5944) was used to evaluate the tissue adhesive   capacity of the hydrogels with different substrates. Briefly, porcine skin was used as the   represented skin tissue. The contact area of the hydrogels to porcine skin was 20 mm × 20   mm, after being pressed by 50 g weight for 5 min, the tensile lap shear were tested   immediately, the shear adhesive strength was calculated as the maximum load divided by the   contact lap area. All the experiments were performed in triplicate to reduce the error.  2.6 Antibacterial Ability Test   In this work, the antibacterial property of hydrogels were tested against Escherichia coli (E.   coli, Gram negative) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus, Gram positive). Luria−Bertani   agar (LB agar) and Luria−Bertani broth (LB broth) were used as culture media. First, the   microorganisms were sub-cultured in appropriate culture media to confirm their purity.

Mechanical properties. The uniaxial tensile tests were carried out at the stretch rate of   50 mm/min with a 30 N load cell. To examine the recovery property, the hydrogel   sample was first stretched to a predetermined 500% strain (stretching rate: 50mm/min),   and then re-stretched at the same rate after recovery for different times (0, 10, 20 min).   The energy dissipation can be obtained by calculating the area of the hysteresis loop.   The recovery rate was defined as the ratio of energy dissipation and maximum stress   after different recovery time to the first cycle.  Cylindrical hydrogel samples with a diameter of 10 mm and a height of 12 mm were   used for compression tests. And the test was carried out with a 5000 N load cell   (compression rate: 10 mm/min). For cyclic compression test, silicone oil was applied   to the surface of the hydrogel to prevent evaporation. Besides, the cyclic compression   strain was set at 80% and the cyclic compression rate was set at 10 mm/min.  Pure shear test was performed to test the tearing energy of hydrogel. The notched (8   mm) and unnotched hydrogel samples (a0: 20 mm; b0: 2 mm) were prepared.

Unlike their synthetic counterparts, genetically engineered polymers are produced without the use of toxic reagents and can easily be programmed to incorporate desirable hydrogel properties, including bioactivity, biodegradability, and monodispersity. Herein, we report the development of a copolymeric hydrogel that is based on the calcium-dependent protein, calmodulin (CaM). For our system, CaM and M13, a CaM-binding peptide, were incorporated into genetically engineered polymers with intervening linkers containing cleavable sequences. Spectroscopic and multiple- particle tracking (MPT) studies demonstrate that these polymers self-assemble through calcium-stabilized, noncovalent crosslinking to form a soft viscoelastic material. MPT further revealed that gelation is concentration-dependent. Collagenase digests show that the protein polymers are selectively degraded through specific cleavage. The modularity and stimuli-responsiveness of this system suggest its potential as a flexible scaffold for biomedical applications.  ■ INTRODUCTION Since they were first proposed for biological use in 1960,1  hydrogels have been studied and used extensively for numerous in vivo applications including wound dressing,2  controlled drug delivery,3−6 tissue engineering,7−11 and biological sensing.12−15 In short, hydrogels are defined as three-dimensional polymeric networks capable of retaining large amounts of water while maintaining their structure. This unique property is attributed to the hydrophilic nature of their constituent polymers, which normally range from naturally occurring polymers (e.g., polypeptides16−19 and polysacchar- ides3,20−22) to chemically synthesized polymers (e.g., acryl- amide,23,24 poly (vinyl alcohol),25−27 poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)28−30) and even hybrids of the two.31−34 In the last couple of decades, there has been increasing interest in exploiting protein engineering for the development of self- assembling hydrogels for biomedical applications due to the advantages of genetically engineered protein polymers.35−44  Various classes of genetically engineered polymers have been developed to form hydrogels, including silk-like polymers,45,46  silk-collagen polymers,47 elastin-like polymers (ELPs),48,49 silk- elastin-like polymers,45,50 collagen-like copolymers,51,52 and leucine zipper copolymers.53 Broadly speaking, these classes are similar in that they all incorporate repetitions of specific sequence motifs derived from naturally occurring proteins to elicit noncovalent crosslinking through the formation of secondary or supersecondary structures (e.g., β-sheets, β- spirals, and α-helical coiled-coils). In contrast, we have developed engineered protein polymers that form crosslinks  through specific noncovalent interactions between two differ- ent components, calmodulin (CaM) and the CaM-binding peptide M13, that will assemble in response to the high concentration of extracellular calcium ions found in vivo. Our two-component system consists of two genetically  engineered proteins that have repetitions of either CaM or M13 separated by a linker segment. This CaM- and M13-based hydrogel system is represented schematically in Scheme 1. The  Received: January 10, 2020 Revised: April 9, 2020  Scheme 1.

The CaM-based polymer consists of three repeats of CaM with intervening 20-residue linker segments that contain one collagen-derived sequence (GPQGIWGQ), which is sensitive to cleavage by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) known as collagenases. The M13- based polymer consists of three repeats of M13 with the same 20-residue linkers segments. We will refer to these polymers as calmodulin collagen-like polymers (CCLP3) and peptide collagen-like polymers (PCLP3). CaM was chosen due to its specific, calcium-dependent, high-affinity interaction with M13 and its remarkable resilience to denaturants54,55 and high temperatures.56 CaM is a well-studied, intracellular calcium signaling protein with two globular domains connected by a flexible central helix.57 The C- and N-terminal domains both contain a pair of EF-hand motifs that bind calcium and then M13 in an ordered series of events; calcium binds with Kd &lt; 10 μM,58−60 inducing exposure of the hydrophobic pocket in each domain; then, these hydrophobic pockets bind to M13 (Kd = 10 nM)61 to form a specific, high-affinity complex. Since CaM and M13 bind each other under typical extracellular conditions, we expected that mixtures of hydrophilic CaM- based and M13-based polymers would lead to the formation of a hydrogel. Our two-component system was designed to be easily tunable by modifying the sequence of CaM, M13, or the linker segment, to self-assemble in situ within the extracellular space where free calcium ion concentrations are tightly regulated between 1.1 and 1.5 mM,62−64 and to be susceptible to endogenous extracellular proteases for targeted degradation for applications such as in situ drug delivery.3−6  Due to CaM’s unique properties and structure, it has attracted interest in engineered protein-based systems. CaM- based fusion proteins have been developed as intracellular calcium sensors (c.f.65−67), as calcium-activated hydrogel switches for microfluidic devices,68 and as sponge-like hydrogel delivery systems for bioactive agents.69−73 Since these technologies either measure or require fluxes in calcium levels to function, their application is not appropriate in the extracellular matrix where calcium concentration is consistently maintained within a narrow range. However, there are two reports known to us of CaM-based materials that exploit the extracellular calcium levels for stabilization. Topp et al. reported a CaM-based “toolkit” comprising polymers with multiple components, including CaM-binding peptides, a peptide that forms a helical bundle, and a segment of PEG.74  Another interesting application of CaM in a novel biomaterial is a self-assembling particle that is made from CaM-ELP polymers,75 in which calcium leads to particle assembly. Our hydrogel system is unique compared to the other CaM-  based hydrogel materials in several ways. First, our system consists of polymers that are entirely encoded on a genetic level, whereas other CaM-based hydrogels are chemically synthesized through reactions that require additional reagents and purification steps.68,69,74,76 Genetically encoded polymers have been reported to exhibit higher monodispersity and are easily programmable, providing increased control over polymer composition, solubility, and lifetime.41,45,49,77−83 Second, our copolymeric hydrogel self-assembles rapidly in response to calcium, a biologically relevant cue, and does not require the addition of crosslinking reagents (allylamine, acrylamide, bisacrylamide, acrylate, APS, TEMED) or photochemical initiators. Facile calcium-induced assembly of our material makes it potentially suitable for in situ formation in biomedical  applications. Third, the binding of calcium elicits gel formation but would not be responsible for the function of the material, such as drug release.68 Finally, the incorporation of collagen- like sequences provides for degradation by endogenous collagenases whose abundance and activity are increased in chronic inflammation84−87 and cancer.88−92  Herein, we submit the first report of a new CaM-based hydrogel that is designed to exploit the high extracellular calcium concentration to form physical crosslinks between the component polymers. The goal of this work is to establish the utility of the hydrogel design by characterizing the fundamental properties of the material. We began our investigation by first elucidating the properties of the component polymers, which include the CaM-M13 interactions, targeted degradation, and rheology. In addition, the polymers were subsequently mixed and studied to characterize conditions for hydrogel formation, the hydrogel erosion profile under degradative and non- degradative conditions, hydrogel morphology, and rheological properties. These studies serve to establish this material’s future potential as a flexible scaffold for biomedical applications.  ■ EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Cloning, Expression, and Purification. The genes for the CaM-  based (CCLP3) and M13-based (PCLP3) polymers each code for three repeats of CaM and M13, respectively, and a C-terminal Cys residue. The coding sequence for MMP cleavage sites was engineered into all genes after each CaM or M13 sequence (GPQG/IWGQ). CCLP3 and PCLP3 genes were synthesized, cloned into pET-28a (+) vectors via NdeI/SalI or NdeI/Xhol restriction sites, and sequenced to confirm their integrity (Genscript, Inc.). All genes were codon optimized for expression in Escherichia coli. BL21(DE3) and DH5α competent cells (Novagen) were subsequently transformed with the expression vectors using a standard protocol and stored at −80 °C as 18% glycerol stocks.  CCLP3 and PCLP3 polymers were expressed and purified from BL21(DE3) expression cells using standard protocols93 with the following exceptions. Cell cultures were grown in lysogeny broth containing 2% w/v tryptone, 1% w/v yeast, and 1% w/v NaCl. After cells were grown on agar plates, a starter culture was inoculated with a single colony and incubated (37 °C at 250 rpm) until the OD600 was ∼0.6 AU. Large 1-L expression cell cultures were inoculated with 5 mL of starter culture and incubated until 0.6−0.8. For CCLP3 transformants, the expression cultures were then induced with 0.8 mM isopropyl thiogalactoside (IPTG) and allowed to express for an additional 5 h at 37 °C at 250 rpm. Alternatively, expression cultures with PCLP3 transformants were removed from the incubator when OD600 was 0.6−0.8, induced with 0.8 mM IPTG, and then expressed at room temperature at 250 rpm for 18 h. After the cells were lysed, CCLP3 was in the soluble fraction but PCLP3 in the insoluble fraction.  For CCLP3 purification, the supernatant was heated to 80 °C for 10 min in the presence of 50 mM CaCl2, centrifuged, and the supernatant was dialyzed against 20 mM Tris, 50 mM CaCl2, 1 mM DTT, and pH 7.4 (binding buffer). The dialyzed samples were then loaded onto phenyl sepharose (GE Healthcare).94 The stationary phase was washed with 3 column volumes of binding buffer, followed by 3 column volumes of wash buffer (20 mM Tris, 50 mM CaCl2, 0.5 M NaCl, 1 mM DTT, pH 7.4). CCLP3 was then eluted with 10 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 200 mM Tris, and pH 7.4. Fractions containing purified CCLP3 were dialyzed against deionized water, lyophilized, and stored as a dry powder at −20 °C. For PCLP3 purification, the lysate pellet was washed three times with diluted Triton X-100 (ThermoFisher), centrifuged, and resuspended in denaturing HisTag chromatography buffer (20 mM Tris, 5 mM imidazole, 6 M urea, pH 7.9) and loaded onto a Ni-NTA resin (ThermoFisher) under denaturing conditions with imidazole-based  Biomacromolecules pubs.acs.org/Biomac Article  https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biomac.0c00043 Biomacromolecules XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX  B  <div class=""annotation""><a href=""http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.biomac.0c00043/suppl_file/bm0c00043_si_001.pdf"">http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.biomac.0c00043/suppl_file/bm0c00043_si_001.pdf</a> <div class=""annotation""><a href=""pubs.acs.org/Biomac?ref=pdf"">pubs.acs.org/Biomac?ref=pdf</a> <div class=""annotation""><a href=""https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biomac.0c00043?ref=pdf"">https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biomac.0c00043?ref=pdf</a>  ","=HYPERLINK(""sem/10.1021_acs.biomac.0c00043\supp_1.jpg"",""sem/10.1021_acs.biomac.0c00043\supp_1.jpg"")"

The fractions containing purified PCLP3 were dialyzed against denaturing 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethane- sulfonic acid buffer (10 mM HEPES, 140 mM NaCl, 6 M urea, pH 7.4) and stored at −20 °C. The purity of the protein stocks was assessed using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electro- phoresis (SDS-PAGE) stained with Coomassie blue. The concen- trations of CCLP3 and PCLP3 were determined using calculated extinction coefficients,95 32 430 and 35 420 M−1 cm−1, respectively. The molecular weights of the polymers were confirmed by matrix- assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) (Voyager-DE, Perspective Biosystems) using a sinapinic acid matrix. Circular Dichroism. Calcium binding and protein−protein  interactions were monitored by the change in the circular dichroism (CD) signal using an AVIV 202SF CD spectrometer. Polymer samples (20 μM) were dissolved in HEPES buffer (10 mM HEPES, 140 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 3 M urea. Exceptions are noted in figure legends. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were acquired from 200 to 300 nm in 1 nm increments at 25 °C with a 3 s averaging time. Each sample was scanned in triplicate. The path length of the cuvette was 0.1 mm. Data were corrected for the buffer spectrum and then offset corrected. Proteolysis of Collagen-Derived Sequences. The human  matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) (AnaSpec, Inc.) was selected to test degradation of the MMP-sensitive sequence by a specific interstitial human collagenase. MMP-1 was activated by incubating at 37 °C with 1 mM 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate for 3 h. Following activation, MMP-1 (20 nM) was added to 50 μM CCLP3 and incubated at 37 °C. During digestion, 10 μL samples were taken at 0, 48, and 72 h. Proteolysis was quenched with the addition of 2X SDS reducing loading buffer, and samples were stored at −20°C. The cleavage products were then visualized using SDS-PAGE. No proteolytic digests were attempted for PCLP3, since the stock contains 6 M urea, a condition that impairs enzyme function. For pH- dependence studies, digests of CCLP3 were conducted using collagenase type I (Gibco), a crude isolate from Clostridium histolyticum containing a mixture of seven collagenases (weighing 68−130 kDa). CCLP3 solutions (200 μM) were prepared at pHs 5.7, 6.5, and 7.4 using 2-ethanesulfonic acid buffer (100 mM MES, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl2, 0.05% NaN3) and Tris buffer (100 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl2, 0.05% NaN3). Collagenase (0.02 mg/mL) was incubated with the protein polymer solutions at 37 °C over a period of 21 h, and 10 μL samples were taken at various timepoints as noted in the figure legend. Proteolysis was quenched and the cleavage products were then visualized as described above. For the digest conducted at pH 5.4, enzymatic activity was undetectable (data not shown). Hydrogel Formation. The general procedure for hydrogel  formation was as follows: Solution A: lyophilized CCLP3 was resuspended in 10 mM HEPES, 140 mM NaCl, and pH 7.4 at a desired concentration; Solution B: PCLP3 dissolved in denaturing HEPES buffer (10 mM HEPES, 140 mM NaCl, 6 M urea, pH 7.4) was concentrated, or diluted, to the desired concentration. To Solution A, a small volume of CaCl2 and NaN3 was added and mixed by gently pipetting. This solution was then combined with a volume of Solution B to create a 1:1 molar ratio, mixed by gentle pipetting, and allowed to equilibrate at room temperature for approximately 20 min. Unless otherwise specified, the final concentrations of added calcium and NaN3, a bacteriostatic agent, were 20 mM and 0.05% (w/ v), respectively. To test the stabilizing effect of calcium ions on hydrogel formation, the following experiment was performed. Polymers were mixed (1:1 mole ratio) in microcentrifuge tubes to form hydrogels in the absence of added calcium; contaminating calcium ion concentration is ∼5 μM as determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy.54,96 Calcium was added to one gel sample to a total concentration of 20 mM. The chelator EDTA was added to the other to a total of 5 mM concentration to chelate the contaminating calcium ions. To test the effect of temperature on hydrogels, a sample of 18% w/v hydrogel was prepared at 25 °C in 20 mM CaCl2. The sample was subsequently placed in boiling water (100 °C) for 10 min.  Hydrogel Erosion and Degradation. Erosion profiles of the hydrogel were determined spectroscopically. In a microcentrifuge tube, 50 μL of hydrogels (9 and 18% w/v) were formed as described above. To each hydrogel, 1 mL of erosion buffer (100 mM HEPES, 140 mM NaCl, 3 M urea, 1 mM CaCl2, 0.05% w/v NaN3, pH 7.4) was added and the samples were incubated at 37 °C. The 1 mL of erosion buffer was collected and replaced at specified timepoints over a period of 48 h. The percent mass loss of protein was calculated by determining the summative mass of eroded protein in the overlying buffer, using the absorption at 280 nm, and subsequently dividing by the total mass (the mass of protein that was calculated to be present in the hydrogels formed). Studies were done in triplicate.  Proteolytic degradation of 9 and 18% w/v hydrogels was also determined using the same procedure. To each hydrogel, 1 mL of degrading erosion buffer (0.02 mg/mL collagenase, 100 mM HEPES, 140 mM NaCl, 3 M urea, 10 mM CaCl2, 0.05% w/v NaN3, pH 7.4) was added and the samples were incubated at 37 °C. The 1 mL of buffer was collected and replaced at specified timepoints over a period of 48 h. Studies were done in triplicate.  Scanning Electron Microscopy. To assess the morphology of the hydrogel, samples were prepared and imaged with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Using the general procedure described above, 10% (w/v) hydrogels were formed in microfuge tubes, flash- frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then dehydrated by lyophilization under vacuum at −5 °C for at least 24 h. Lyophilized samples were then fractured using a razor to reveal the interior, mounted, sputtered with a thin layer (∼10 nm) of Pt, and then imaged using traditional SEM JSM-7200 FLV FE-SEM in the School of Pharmacy Electron Microscopy Facility at the University of Mississippi.  Multiple-Particle Tracking (MPT). Particle tracking is a technique that utilizes micron-sized spherical tracers to probe the microstructure and even local or bulk rheological properties of the soft material in which they are embedded.97 This is done by tracking the thermally driven displacements of the colloidal particles in real time to obtain their ensemble-averaged mean square displacement (MSD), which can then be used to calculate the complex shear moduli (i.e., viscosity and shear moduli) of the medium. For our studies, a Leica SP8 confocal laser scanning microscope in the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Mississippi, mounted on a Leica DMI 8 inverted microscope with 63× NA 1.40 and 40× NA 1.30 oil immersion objectives, was used to record the motion of 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 μm fluorescent carboxylate-modified polystyrene spheres (Molecular Probes, Inc.). The tracer particles were mixed with polymer samples at concentrations of 0.02−0.2 vol % (∼107−109 particles/μL) to ensure that at least 100 particles were tracked per frame. Sample volumes of 8 μL were loaded into 120-μm- deep spacer wells (Invitrogen) between coverslips of 0.17 mm thickness and immediately sealed to prevent evaporation and drift. For hydrogels, tracers were added to each solution of polymer, which were then mixed in wells and allowed to equilibrate for 30 min before imaging. Tracers were excited at 510 nm using a white light laser, and their fluorescence was monitored at 520−570 nm. Field of view areas of 512 × 256 pixels (158 μm × 79 μm) and 512 × 512 pixels (158 μm × 158 μm) were chosen to obtain a scan rate of 50 and 30 Hz, respectively, using the resonant scanning mode. The optical section was optimized to monitor a single layer of microspheres with a lateral resolution of 155 nm. Particle positions were recorded for 1−10 min yielding 3038−18 300 frames. All videos were recorded at a depth of at least 20 μm to minimize hydrodynamic interactions with the coverslip. Interactive Data Language (IDL, Harris Geospatial Solutions) routines developed by Crocker and Grier98 were used to trace particle trajectories, determine the MSDs, and extract viscosities. All MSD data points were required to include a sampling size of ∼1000 displacement measurements to increase the statistical accuracy of the results. Routines in the IDL routines were not altered, however, parameters for locating features using the routines (e.g., bandpass filter, feature size, masscut/lower brightness cutoff) vary between samples. Each data set was optimized individually. The recorded videos were saved as tiff files, which are directly read into IDL.

https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.biomac.0c00043,Development and Characterization of Calmodulin-Based Copolymeric Hydrogels,,"rheology, modulus, moduli, storage, elastic, shear"," Prior to microrheology studies of the novel materials, MSDs of 0.5 and 1 μm tracer particles in glycerol (0−70% w/w) were used to validate our MPT scheme (see Figures S2 and S3). The MSD, ⟨Δr2(τ)⟩, is a function of lag time, τ = nΔt, where Δt is the time interval between consecutive frames and n is a positive integer. The shortest lag time possible (τ = Δt) is determined by the inverse of the frame rate in which the video is recorded, which is typically 30−100 Hz. The longest lag time is limited by the total duration of the video. In two dimensions, the MSD for an ensemble of particles is defined as  ∑τ τ τ⟨Δ ⟩ = ⟨[ + − ] + [ + − ] ⟩ =  r N  x t x t y t y t( ) 1  ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) i  N  i n i i n i 2  1  2 2  (1)  where x and y represent the ith particle’s positions. The brackets indicate a time-average over all start times t for a single particle trajectory at a given lag time τn, and 1/N ∑i=1  N represents the ensemble-average over all particle trajectories N for each lag time observed. Thus, as lag time increases, the sample size of observed particle displacements decreases, thereby lowering the confidence in the calculated MSD. This statistical error was mitigated by increasing the number of measured displacements required to calculate an MSD data point for any given τ. The double-logarithmic plot of MSD versus τ was fit to a power law, in which the data’s slope, α, qualitatively describes the rheological properties of a medium and is defined as  α τ  τ =  ⟨Δ ⟩d r d  ln ( ) ln  2  (2)  For a purely viscous medium, such as aqueous glycerol, the log−log plot of MSD versus lag time τ for an ensemble of thermally driven particles increases linearly with time, MSD ∼ τα=1. Using the diffusion equation, the MSD can be related to the diffusion coefficient, D, by the following formula  τ τ⟨Δ ⟩ =r dD( ) 22 (3)  where d is the dimensionality of the displacements (2 for our studies). The viscosity of the material can then be calculated using the Stokes− Einstein equation  η π  = k T  aD6 B  (4)  where kB is Boltzmann’s constant, T is absolute temperature, and a is the radius of the particle.  In contrast, particles embedded in a purely elastic medium will have constrained motion and their displacement will fluctuate around an equilibrium position, resulting in a constant MSD over time (α = 0). Viscoelastic materials are more complex, possessing characteristics of both viscous and elastic materials, and are capable of both dissipating energy (viscous component) and storing energy (elastic component). The slope of a log−log plot for viscoelastic materials falls in between the elastic and viscous limits (0 &lt; α &lt; 1), as observed in the materials under study here. A slope less than one suggests slow or subdiffusion within the medium and indicates an elastic response. Although the slope of the MSD plot can be used to describe the viscoelastic properties of a medium, the MSD can also be used to quantitate viscoelasticity in terms of the storage and loss moduli provided that the continuum requirement is met by the materials. For viscoelastic materials, a generalized Stokes−Einstein relation (GSER)99−102 can be used to determine the complex shear modulus, G*(ω), which can then be related to the storage G′(ω) and loss G″(ω) moduli. The GSER is defined in the Fourier domain as  ω π ω ω  * = ⟨Δ ⟩  G k T  ai r i ( )  ( ) B  2 (5)  ω ω ω* = ′ + ″G G iG( ) ( ) ( ) (6)  where = −i 1 , the angular frequency ω = 2π/τ, and ⟨Δr2(iω)⟩ is the unilateral Fourier transform of the MSD. Since the Fourier transform requires an infinite range, and the MSD data only cover a limited range, implementation of this process can result in significant errors in G*(ω) near the frequency extremes of the MSD data. To help circumvent such errors, a local power law expansion of the MSD around a desired frequency, ω, that was developed by Mason et al., and improved upon by Dasgupta et al., can be used to derive algebraic estimates of the transforms.103,104 However, for the studies reported here, the MSD data were sufficient to describe the rheological properties of our material.  ■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Expression and Purification of CCLP3 and PCLP3.

The selected ranges of polymer concen- trations correspond to the concentrations of each polymer used to form 4−18% hydrogels in a 1:1 mole ratio in  subsequent experiments. MPT results obtained for relatively dilute concentrations of CCLP3 (c ≤ 7%) and PCLP3 (c ≤ 2% w/v) revealed MSD values that increased linearly with lag time τ (slope α = 0.94 ± 0.01) over the time observed (Figure 9A,B). The probe dynamics in these dilute polymeric solutions reflect simple diffusion, α ≈ 1, which indicates a predominantly viscous response of the suspensions of CCLP3 and PCLP3 in the lower range of polymer concentration. In higher concentrations of CCLP3 (7% &lt; c ≥ 13%) and PCLP3 (2% &lt; c ≥ 9%), the mobility of the particles was increasingly constrained at short lag times (τ &lt; 0.5 s), having MSDs with initial slopes of α = 0.53 ± 0.24 and α = 0.51 ± 0.18, respectively. The subdiffusion of probes within these polymeric solutions reflects a predominantly elastic response of the  ","=HYPERLINK(""sem/10.1021_acs.biomac.0c00043\supp_7.jpg"",""sem/10.1021_acs.biomac.0c00043\supp_7.jpg"")"

However, at lag times greater than 0.5 s, particle dynamics in these concentrated CCLP3 and PCLP3 solutions approached simple diffusion (α = 0.92 ± 0.05 and α = 0.94 ± 0.05, respectively). The sublinear scaling of MSD with τ, ⟨Δr2(τ)⟩ ∼τα&lt;1, at higher concentrations is a common characteristic of complex viscoelastic fluids such as polymeric solutions, which can exhibit fibrillar entanglements and large-scale molecular motions on timescales as low as milliseconds.126 The fibrous nature of these protein polymers is further illustrated by directly comparing the corresponding MSD data with that of the globular protein BSA (","=HYPERLINK(""sem/10.1021_acs.biomac.0c00043\supp_8.jpg"",""sem/10.1021_acs.biomac.0c00043\supp_8.jpg"")"

Finally, studies of 5 mM CCLP3 (28% w/v) and 5 mM PCLP3 (9% w/v) were performed, since these are the concentrations of polymers that are mixed to form a 18% hydrogel. For CCLP3 solutions at this high concentration, particle motion was subdiffusive (α = 0.45) over the total time observed, whereas particles in 9% (5 mM) PCLP3 transitioned from slow to quick diffusion as lag time increased. Ultimately, these MPT results obtained for the polymer solutions confirm that the hydrogel components are fibrous in nature possessing elastic character and that polymer suspensions confer greater elasticity as concentrations increase due to the formation of transient entanglements. For microrheological studies of the hydrogels, the two  polymers were mixed in the presence of calcium to form 4− 18% w/v solutions with 1.0 μm tracer particles embedded, allowed to equilibrate for 30 min, and then analyzed using MPT.

When the total polymer concentration was increased to 9% w/v, particle motion became highly restricted (Δr ∼200 nm) at τ values less than 1 s, but showed signs of slow diffusion (α &gt; 0.4) at longer lag times. Additionally, particles embedded in 13 and 18% w/v hydrogels appeared increasingly confined (Δr ∼ 110 nm) with no indication of diffusion over the time observed. This observed elastic response is due to the formation of physical crosslinks between CCLP3 and PCLP3.

Ultimately, these findings demonstrate that there is a critical concentration (4% &lt; c &lt; 9%) of polymer required to sufficiently facilitate the degree of crosslinking necessary for network formation. Once formed, the gel’s microenvironment resembles that of a porous elastic solid and allows for slow diffusion of micron-sized particles at low concentrations, but increasingly restricts  ","=HYPERLINK(""sem/10.1021_acs.biomac.0c00043\supp_8.jpg"",""sem/10.1021_acs.biomac.0c00043\supp_8.jpg"")"

S2E-G). As aldehyde concentration of LCA was set   to be stoichiometric, so almost all aldehyde was consumed to form imine crosslinks, while plenty   of free aldehyde groups still existed in MCA. In MCA-perhydrol, free aldehyde was consumed up,   leading to a reduced relaxing rate, which suggested the significance of free aldehyde in the   viscoelastic DHA-collagen network. In theory, CON possess no imine bonds and LCA is   stoichiometric, so the glycine or perhydrol treatment is designed to be invalid to CON and LCA,   and coincide of the stress relaxing curves should appear in Figure. S3C, E, and F. The differences   exhibited in experimental results attributed to the pH changes after treatment. Further, we   investigated the influence of excessive aldehyde on imine chemical kinetics. As gelation profiles   shown (Figure. S2H), the gelation of DHA and collagen at 37 ℃ (without photopolymerization)   was accelerated with increasing aldehyde concentration, indicating faster imine formation rates.   Hence, the excessive aldehyde enhances the ability of dynamic network to regenerate imine.   These results revealed aldehyde concentration is a crucial parameter in preparing static-dynamic   DHA-collagen network, by increasing the density and regenerating speed of imine, a higher   aldehyde concentration brings up more flexible and dynamic network with less time-scale   mechanics.

The solution was bubbled  with nitrogen for 15 minutes. Subsequently, 15 µL of a 0.5 mL aqueous solution that included 50 mg APS  and 25 µL TEMED was added to the monomer solution. The solution was polymerized at room temperature  for 5 minutes, before the resulting solution was further polymerized at 4 °C for 12 hours. After  polymerization, the unreacted monomer units, the initiator and salts were washed away using a MWCO  10K spin filter (Amicon). The purified polymers were used for modification of glucosamine. To an aqueous  MES buffer solution (10 mM, pH = 5.5), 1.3 mL, that included the as synthesized polymer,  N-(3-Dimethylaminopropyl)-N’-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride, 25 mg, and sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide,  28 mg, was added and incubated for 15 minutes. Then 1.3 mL of a HEPES buffer solution (50 mM, pH =  7.2) that included 0.05 M glucosamine were added. The mixture was allowed to react for 6 hours. The  modified polymers were purified using a MWCO 10K spin filter (Amicon).    Preparation of DOX-loaded hydrogel Ia and Ib  A 120 µL HEPES buffer solution (HEPES, 10 mM, MgCl2, 100 mM, pH = 7.0) that contains AAm (5 M,  12 µL), BAA (0.01 M, 3 µL), irgacure (0.4 M, 2.4 µL) and DNA (1) (5 mM, 8 µL) was prepared and DOX  (10 mM, 1µL), AuNPs (80 nM) or AuNRs (50 nM) were added into the solution. The solution was bubbled  for 10 min with nitrogen and irradiated under UV light for 10 min to form the hydrogels Ia and Ib. After  washing, the hydrogels Ia and Ib were irradiated with 532 nm and 808 nm laser to trigger the release of  doxorubicin, respectively.    Preparation of DOX-loaded hydrogel IIa and IIb  The DNA (2)/phenylboronate functionalized polymer (2%) and DNA (2)/glucosamine functionalized  polymer (2%) were mixed in a HEPES buffer solution (10 mM, MgCl2, 100 mM, pH = 8.0) that contains  AuNPs (50 nM) or AuNRs (20 nM), and doxorubicin (1 mM) to yield a polymer solution. The solution was  heated to 90 °C and then kept overnight to form a hydrogel. After washing, the hydrogels IIa and IIb were  irradiated with 532 nm and 808 nm laser to trigger the release of doxorubicin, respectively.     The model for the evaluation of the bent curvature     The model considers the equilibrium curvature of the hydrogel bilayer as the minimum of an elastic free  energy, representing the thermodynamically stable state. The system is simplified by considering the sum of  two important elastic free energy terms (eq 1), Etot = Eex + Eb, as parameters controlling the hydrogel  stretching and hydrogel bending. These free energy terms account for the main deformations that the  hydrogel undergoes when the two layers are coupled, compared with the same hydrogel layers when  decoupled under the same solution conditions.  In eq 2, Yn is the Young′s modulus, δn (can be positive or negative in sign) is the deviation in hydrogel  length from the equilibrium length (Ln) of the same hydrogel in the decoupled system, b is layer width, cn is  layer thickness, and n = 1, 2 is the bilayer index, Rm is the (average) hydrogel radius of curvature.  In eq 3, the bending modulus k can be shown theoretically to be k = Yc3/[a(1 − ν2)], where v is the  Poisson’s s ratio for the hydrogel (typically assumed to be 0.5) and a is a parameter related to the material  structure and properties and a = 12 results in good fits for all systems studied here. We also account for  hydrogel thickness and Young′s modulus variations due to hydrogel deformation compared with the values  found at equilibrium with the following linear scaling for the Young′s modulus, Yn = Yn,0 -  Yn,0(δn,theor/4δn,exp), and for thickness Cn = Cn,exp - (Cn,exp - Cn,0)( δn,theor/δn,exp). In these expressions, the  subscript 0 represents the values prior to hydrogel bending, the subscript “theor” represents the deformation  value if no variation in Y and C is assumed, while the subscript “exp” is the experimental value.

This makes the  manufacturing of the composite hydrogels    difficult that is why we have limited ourselves to volume fraction 60%. Furthermore, increasing   the volume fraction above 60% has only minor added value to loading as the loading value   asymptotically approaches 100%. If more than 85% loading is required for an application, the   formulation can be modified  to increase the elasticity of the composite material by increasing   the % of ALG in the continuous phase. Another possibility is to decrease the size of hydrogel   beads so that their weight would be small compared to the elasticity of the material.

For the uncrosslinked sample, buoyancy force   (Fb) acting on the droplets F� = � �πR�  �∆ρ, Fb is balanced by the viscous drag (Fv) given by the  Stokes flow approximation  [3]   as F� = 2πμ�UR� �  ���� ��� �	  and droplets achieve a terminal   velocity of creaming where Rd is the droplet radius, ∆ρ is the density difference,  µ1, µ2 are the  dispersed and continuous  phase viscosity and α is the ratio of dispersed phase to continuous   phase viscosities, α = ���� . However, in the crosslinked sample the buoyancy force is balanced by  the elastic force resisting the deformation of the polymer network. For a droplet to translate in   this elastic network, the stress applied by the droplet on the gel should be large enough to yield   the network. The stress due to buoyancy is given by σ� = ��  �����  . If this stress is larger than the   yield stress of the hydrogel network (σy), the droplets can break loose and cream or sediment   depending on the density difference (∆ρ). A dimensionless yield-creaming number Yc = #�#$   denotes the competition of these forces. If Yc is larger than unity, the network is not strong   enough to hold the droplets in place.

S1         A simple force balance argument can be made to demonstrate suppression of creaming in   crosslinked composite hydrogels in more detail. The buoyancy force (Fb) can be calculated as   5*10 -10   N when ∆ρ=100 kg/m 3 , R=50 µm. We want to know rather this force is enough to   deform the hydrogel matrix to a point that it yields. The rheological characterization of ALG   hydrogels has been reported in a previous study [4]  . The yield stress of 2%ALG matrix is in the   order of 12 kPa.  Knowing these values we can calculate the force and a stress buoyancy force   induces on the network. The stress due to buoyancy applied on the hydrogel network is given by   ./ = 01  �234� = 34∆5�  .If this stress is larger than the yield stress of the hydrogel network (σy), the   droplets can break loose cream or sediment depending on the density difference (∆6).

If elasto-creaming number is larger than one the network is not strong enough to hold  the droplets in place. For 2% ALG, the yield stress measured by rheology via a stress sweep   protocol is reported as 12kPsia [4]  .

S12: Influence of evaporation on counteracting growth of crystals   The aqueous solvent evaporates from the hydrogel faster that the ANI due to difference in vapor   pressure. When water evaporates considerably, anisole droplets carrying FEN have barely   evaporated (movie 2). The hypothesis presented in this manuscript is that the hydrogel provides a   confinement induced elastic energy barrier to counteract (i) evaporation induced coalescence (ii)   crystal growth beyond the size of droplets. There is an additional mechanism helping the   hydrogel matrix to counteract the crystal growth. As water evaporates the hydrogel matrix dries   and the gel matrix stiffens. This evaporation stiffing mechanism is only a secondary mechanism   for counteracting crystal growth. In other words, even without this stiffing mechanism the elastic   energy barrier would be sufficiently large to counteract crystal growth. The elasticity of   hydrogels used in this study was previously characterized using rheology [4]  . It is not difficult to   imagine that the when a hydrogel dries it becomes stiffer therefore we believe this secondary   mechanism is likely support our claims.      We conducted noninvasive Neutron scattering measurements on dry and hydrated 2% ALG   hydrogels.

Time sweep measurement was conducted at 0.1   Hz and 0.1% strain to find G’, and G” at the linear viscoelastic region.  Frequency sweep was   then conducted from 0.01 Hz to 10 Hz.   Compress modulus measurements: Hydrogel plugs measuring 5 mm by 3 mm were made and   the compressive moduli were measured by subjecting hydrogel to 20% strain at a constant rate of   0.05 mm/s using MTS machine (Synergie 100, MTS Systems, Eden Prairie, MN) with a 50 g   load cell.  Utilizing parallel plate geometry that measures force as a function of deformation, the   modulus at the initial lower linear portion of the stress–strain curve were calculated (n=3).

Following a modified   literature procedure,2  hydrogels were prepared by instant freezing in liquid nitrogen and   subsequent lyophilizing at –50˚C overnight at 50 millitorr for 24 h.

Shown in log scale, a   rapid increase in both the storage and loss modulus was observed within the first 20 min (Fig.   S1A).  Subsequent changes in the modulus were minimal.  The fact that the storage modulus is   orders of magnitude larger than the loss modulus is indicative of the formation of a gel.  This is   further confirmed by conducting a frequency sweep, where a stable G’ at the frequencies tested   was observed (Fig. S1B).
