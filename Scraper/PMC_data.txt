Comparison of the deconvoluted peaks of (d) O 1s, (e) P 2p, and (f) N 1s for both 0% nSi and 0.5% nSi systems. The experimental data points are shown as solid black lines. The rearrangement of the O 1s peak components and the shift of P 2p peak confirmed the presence of attractive electrostatic interactions between the oxygen atom of phosphate anion (PO2\u2212) and silicate nanodisks.

(a) MTS assay at 24 and 72 h of hASCs in contact with the nanocomposite hydrogels revealed no significant difference in cell viability irrespective of the concentration of nSi used. Cells grown under serum-starved conditions served as a positive control. (b) Representative fluorescence images of actin stained with Alexa Fluor 488 Phalloidin (green) and nuclei stained with DAPI (blue), of hASCs after 72 h of contact with the hydrogels. Cells grown under serum-starved conditions served as a positive control (scale bar = 400 \u03bcm). (c) Comparison of release profiles of Dex from DNA hydrogels without nSi and the nanocomposite systems over a period of 10 days. Results are shown as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation (n = 3). (d) Half-release time (t1/2) of Dex as a function of nSi concentration confirmed the sustained release behavior of the nanocomposite hydrogels.

Both the Dex-treated group (+nSi) and cells grown in osteoinductive media (pos ctrl) show high levels of ALP, representing osteogenic differentiation of hASCs (scale bar = 400 \u03bcM). (b) Alizarin red staining of hASCS after 7 and 14 days to detect the calcium deposition (scale bar = 400 \u03bcM). Intense red staining signifies osteogenic differentiation of hASCs. (c) ALP quantification demonstrated levels of ALP expression in the Dex-treated group significantly higher than those of the cells grown in basal media (neg ctrl) and osteoconductive media (OC). (d) Quantification of the deposited calcium confirmed significantly higher amounts of calcium in the Dex-treated group as compared to that in neg ctrl and OC. (e) qPCR analysis of different osteogenic markers after 14 days of Dex treatment. The fold expression increase of ALP and COLA1 was assessed following the \u0394\u0394Ct relative method.
